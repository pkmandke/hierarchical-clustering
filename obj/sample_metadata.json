The Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) technique is one of the most promising position location techniques for cellular-type wireless communication systems. The IS-95 Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system is a popular choice for the companies deploying new cellular and PCS systems in North America. Hence, the feasibility of TDOA techniques in CDMA systems is an important issue for position location in the wireless systems of the future.  This thesis analyzes the performance of TDOA techniques in the CDMA systems. A comparison and assessment of different algorithms for finding the time difference estimates and for solving the hyperbolic equations generated by those estimates has been made. This research also considers a measure of accuracy for TDOA position location method which is shown to be more suitable for CDMA systems and more closely matches to the FCC requirements. Among the other contributions is a proposed method to perform cross-correlations to identify only the desired user's TDOA in a multiuser environment.  This thesis also evaluates the feasibility and accuracy of TDOA techniques under varying system conditions that might be encountered in real situations. This includes varying conditions of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), Multiple Access Interference (MAI), power control and loading. The effect of the mobile position and of different arrangement of base stations on TDOA accuracy is also studied. Performance comparison in AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels is made. The feasibility of using increased power levels for the 911 user in combination with interference cancellation is also studied. The effect of using a single stage of parallel interference cancellation at neighboring cell sites has also been explored. Non-ideal situations such as imperfect power control in CDMA operation has also been investigated in the context of position location. This thesis also suggests amethod to correct TDOA estimation errors in CDMA. It is shown that this improvement can give greatly improved performance even under worst-case situations. Performance comparison of results with and without that modification has also been made under various conditions.

While upright locomotion is a human characteristic, the way humans direct their locomotion has not been studied extensively. Prior to the late 1940's, little research or scholarly thought was published regarding locomotion. In 1950, J. J. Gibson published one of the first texts on visual perception, which included theories and research on how humans interpret and react to a world of movement, even as they move within that world. Published research on the topic has been sporadic since then, especially when compared to the volume of work on eye-hand coordination and other eye-brain perception issues. Very little work has been documented on humans moving in a \"real world\" setting, not laboratory settings or under very specific timing requirements.  This study begins by proposing a heuristic framework of human navigation, a description of how humans move from point to point, navigating over and across navigation hazards in the walking path. The heuristic model provides an engineering perspective for the safe design of pedestrian areas, allowing sufficient area for visual recognition of hazards.  Two observational studies were performed, one with four different navigation hazards humans come in contact with and the other one with two different hazards that humans pass without contacting. These two classes of hazards involve different perceptual principles. The studies examined the effects of ambient lighting available affected the time required for high attention, fine navigation when approaching a navigation hazard. Specific comparisons between types of navigation hazards were not contemplated, since the perceptual and motor requirements varied considerably among the hazards. Low ambient light levels, representing twilight and night conditions, increase the amount of time required for fine navigation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a statistically significant difference in the fine navigation time to contact a navigation hazard for stairs travelling down, a 900 turn in the path, and walking downhill with a step midway. ANOVA also showed a significant difference in the fine navigation time to pass a navigation hazard for two different hazards. Under all conditions, post hoc analysis showed Night lighting levels were different from Day lighting levels. Practical applications of this research are in the facilities planning and safety design fields. The individual's locomotion speed combined with the fine navigation time required determines the distance needed for visual recognition of the hazard and preparatory locomotor changes. With extensive research, formalized guidelines and standards can be developed for the safe planning, design and redesign of pedestrian walkways. The human factors engineer could interact knowledgeably with other professional designers to assure that walking paths are designed to meet the human's requirements for safe locomotion.

An exploration of the meaning behind the words idea, form, making and experience begins to unite the intellect of an architect with the design of an architect. The terms are defined in the thesis and explained through the project. The thesis through the project sets out to take these terms beyond mere words and give them an opportunity to inform each other. It is this dialectic between idea, form, making and experience that I believe to be the heart of architecture.  Idea and form are inextricably tied to one another. \"Which is the origin of the other?\" is not as pertinent a question as \"how do the two inform each other?\". Ideas change from project to project as do the forms inherent in those ideas. Proceeding both idea and material form is another type of form that is immaterial and often remains unseen. It is the character which is essential to a thing. Whether it be a place or an object, it is the quality in the thing itself. This character is the instigator of idea and form. It is the architect's goal to make this inherent form perceivable.  An architect makes idea and form manifest through a concept of making. In Notes for a Theory of Making in a Time of Necessity, Giuseppe Zambonini emphasizes that \"We must look not only at the quality of the material used and at the craft employed, but also at the quality of the thought process selecting and shaping the material. . .quality cannot be an intrinsic condition that belongs to the object . . . but rather it must express the intent by which it is created and therein the clarity and strength of the meaning being produced by its form\" (Zambonini, 21). This quality of design can best be achieved the earlier making and materiality are involved in the design process. The questions of \"what is the form of this idea?\" and \"how is this form to be made?\" begin the relationship between idea, form and making. The immediate responses may be intuitive, but the final one is the result of numerous makings. This is why architecture is practiced.  When the question arises:\"how can this form not only embody an idea but be the idea?\", the dialogue takes on a greater import. The way in which a thing will be experienced starts to inform its making. \"It is the process that will engage both user and observer in an active, participating relationship with the work and thereby give the work its meaning\" (Zambonini, 21). It is at this point that the dialectic is fully engaged.  These four aspects simultaneously inform each other and nurture the project throughout its life, from drawing board, to construction to the various experiences that it will impart. It is not just one aspect, but these four in communion that are the architecture.

Currently, groundnut output levels are on the decline and no clear reason for the downward trend has been found. Privatization efforts are underway as the government explores ways to breathe some life into the ailing sector, particularly as it relates to groundnut production. The 50 percent currency devaluation of 1994 constituted a major exogenous shock to the sector. Much research has been done about the macro-level impact of the changes that are taking place. However, little work has been done recently (i.e. since the devaluation) at the micro-level. This work addressed this lack by studying the micro-level dynamics of groundnut production. Elasticities were generated and used in the analysis of policy impacts on production. The own-price elasticity of supply groundnut indicated that supply response should be positive following an increase in producer price. The increase in producer prices following the devaluation did not occasion the expected supply response. Possible reasons for this failure were explored. It is hoped that the information revealed will complement the store of information on production in the Groundnut Basin that is already available. Thus, the present work will prove useful to public and private researchers and policy makers seeking to increase their understanding of the sector.

A quick review of the existing analysis techniques and their limitations is first presented.  A discrete nonlinear time-domain model is derived for open-loop DC-DC converters. This model is then extended for closed-loop regulator systems implementing any type of compensation scheme.  The equilibrium solutions of the closed-loop system are calculated and their stability is determined.  The methods developed are used to study the dynamic behavior of a DC-DC buck regulator implementing different types of compensation designproportional, integral, proportional-integral, and proportional-integral-derivative feedback control.  A detailed bifurcation analysis of the dynamic solutions as a design or a control parameter is changed is presented.  A period-doubling route to chaos is shown to exist in voltage-mode regulators, depending on the values of the parameters of the compensator and the input voltage. An investigation of the behavior of the converter in the instability regions has been carried out to shed light on its bifurcations.  The interactions of input filters with DC-DC switching-mode regulators are investigated as well. It is shown that the small-signal averaged model widely used in the design of DC-DC regulators does not provide a complete understanding of the stability of the filter-regulator system. It can only provide the local borders of small-signal stable operation. The large-signal time-domain nonlinear averaged model is used to further understand the interaction on the slow scale using nonlinear analysis techniques. No fast scale interactions, however, can be predicted using this model. A complete nonlinear switching model is thus used to investigate the interaction of the filter and the regulator on all scalesfast and slow.

Its Bedouin community is facing great challenges in its struggle for livelihood and transformation from a pastoral and fishing community to an urbanized one. This case study employs a political ecology approach to examine development on the coast in relation to its Bedouin community. The study revealed that the contextual sources of rapid development beginning in 1986 included urban, economic, and national defense policies; increased integration within international tourism markets; and support from international aid agencies.  The study concluded that the tourism development boom contributes to Bedouin marginalization. Bedouin livelihood no longer depends on fishing and grazing as means of subsistence as expansion of tourism resorts along the coast has displaced other land-uses and denied Bedouin fishermen access to the sea. Tourism resorts and tourism operations controlled by multinational corporations leave little economic benefits to local Bedouins who engage in marginal tourism-related activities. Migrant entrepreneurs from other parts of Egypt compete with Bedouins over work opportunities. Regional and local plans point to increased tourism development and in-migration. This will result in further marginalization of Bedouins if development planning does not consider Bedouin interests. This research comes at a critical time to address some of the issues related to Bedouin marginalization and to recommend alternative development approaches and Bedouin community-based projects. It sets the stage for further research on regional development of South Sinai; the role of national parks in sustaining Bedouins; and future role of civil society.

Several digital technologies have been proposed to replace overburdened analog systems. One system that has gained increasing popularity in North America is a 1.25 MHz Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system (IS-95). In CDMA systems, multiple access interference limits the capacity of any system using conventional single user correlation or matched filter receivers. Previous research has shown that multiuser detection receivers that employ interference cancellation techniques can significantly improve the capacity of a CDMA system. This thesis studies two such structuresthe successive interference cancellation scheme and the parallel interference cancellation scheme. These multiuser receivers are integrated into an IS-95 compatible receiver model which is simulated in software. This thesis develops simulation software that simulates IS-95 with conventional and multiuser receivers in multipath channels and when near-far conditions exist. Simulation results present the robustness of multiuser receivers to near-far in a practical system. In addition to multiuser implemenations, quantization effects from finite bit analog to digital converters (ADC) in CDMA systems will also be simulated.

During that time it lost four consecutive general elections to the Conservative Party. In 1997, however, it now looks set to win its first election since 1974. This thesis examines the Labour Party in opposition since 1979, using a theoretical framework informed by Anthony Giddens' structuration theory. Based on a dialectical notion of the structure and agency linkage, a two-tiered framework is constructed which at one level views a political party as consisting of a set of structures which can constrain and enable party leaders in their attempts to make the party electorally successful, and at another level the party is regarded as a collective agent in its own right, which in turn is subject to the effects of larger external structures. By comparing the strategies adopted by the Labour Party and its leaders since 1979, the thesis demonstrates that the apparent recovery in the Party's electoral fortunes has corresponded with an increase in the ability of agents to successfully negotiate structural constraints, whilst taking advantage of enabling structures. However, it is also clear that the transformation of Labour into an electorally viable party in 1997 is not solely the product of agency in the period since the last election; rather, it is the culmination of a longer-term process of party change.

This well known r-algorithm, which employs a space dilation strategy in the direction of the difference between two successive subgradients, is recognized as being one of the most effective procedures for solving nondifferentiable optimization problems. However, the method needs to store the space dilation matrix and update it at every iteration, resulting in a substantial computational burden for large-sized problems. To circumvent this difficulty, we first develop a memoryless update scheme. In the space transformation sense, the new update scheme can be viewed as a combination of space dilation and reduction operations. We prove convergence of this new algorithm, and demonstrate how it can be used in conjunction with a variable target value method that allows a practical, convergent implementation of the method. For performance comparisons we examine other memoryless and limited memory variants, and also prove a modification of a related algorithm due to Polyak that employs a projection on a pair of Kelley's cutting planes. These variants are tested along with Shor's r-algorithm on a set of standard test problems from the literature as well as on randomly generated dual transportation and assignment problems. Our computational experiments reveal that the proposed memoryless space dilation and reduction algorithm (VT-MSDR) and the proposed modification of the Polyak-Kelly cutting plane method (VT-PKC) provide an overall competitive performance relative to the other methods tested with respect to solution quality and computational effort. The r-Algorithm becomes increasingly more expensive with an increase in problem size, while not providing any gain in solution quality. The fixed dilation (with no reduction) strategy (VT-MSD) provides a comparable, though second-choice, alternative to VT-MSDR. Employing a two-step limited memory extension over VT-MSD sometimes helps in improving the solution quality, although it adds to computational effort, and is not as robust a procedure.

It has been hypothesized that in the absence of a geotextile, intermixing between base course aggregate and soft subgrade occurs. Nine heavily instrumented flexible pavement test sections were built in Bedford County Virginia to investigate the benefits of geosynthetic stabilization in flexible pavements. Three groups of different base course thicknesses (100, 150 and 200mm) test sections were constructed with either geotextile or geogrid stabilization or no stabilization. Woven geotextile was used in sections 2, 5 and 8. Geogrids were used in sections 3, 6 and 9, and sections 1, 4 and 7 were controls. Six Falling weight deflectometer (FWD) tests were performed on all the nine sections over 30 months. The nine sections were subjected to at least 5 load drops with wide loading range each time. The measured deflections were analyzed using the MODULUS back-calculation program to determine layer moduli. The measured deflections were used together with elastic, viscoelastic and the MODULUS program to determine the extent of intermixing at base-subgrade interface. The study concluded that a transition layer would develop when a separator is absent, especially in the weak sections (designed to fail in three years). Other measurements such as in-situ stresses, rut depth, and subsurface profiling (using ground penetrating radar) support the conclusion of the development of a transition layer.

Merr.) is one of the most important crops of the world. Among the various viruses infecting soybean, peanut mottle virus is most commonly found on soybeans in areas where they are grown in close proximity to peanuts. This research was conducted with the primary objective of identifying new genes for resistance to peanut mottle virus. To assign a gene symbol to the resistance gene in cultivar CNS, it was crossed with 'Peking'. Both the F2 and F2:3 lines segregated in a ratio which is expected when one dominant and one recessive gene at two different loci are segregating. Previous studies indicate the presence of one dominant gene in CNS and one recessive gene in Peking for resistance against PMV. This clearly suggests that Peking and CNS possess different resistance genes, which are non-allelic to each other. Now that, all the allelism tests are complete, the resistance gene in CNS can be assigned a gene symbol of Rpv3. PI 486355, a resistant line, was crossed with susceptible cultivars Lee 68 and Essex to study the mode of inheritance of resistance. This PI was found to possess two independent dominant genes for resistance to peanut mottle virus. It was also crossed with 'York' and CNS which are known to have resistance genes at the Rpv1 and Rpv3 loci, respectively. Data from inoculations of F2 and F2:3 progenies indicated that one gene was allelic to Rpv1 and the other is at a locus different from both Rpv1 and Rpv3. PI 398593 was crossed with Lee 68, York, Peking and CNS for studying the nature of resistance genes present in it. No certain conclusions can be drawn regarding the nature of the resistance gene(s) at this stage because of inconsistent behavior of the PI itself. The F2 data of the crosses of PI 398593 with Lee 68, York and CNS supported a recessive nature of the resistance gene present in the PI. F2 plants of the cross PI 398593 x Peking segregated but, not in the expected ratio. F2:3 data of only one cross (PI 398593 x York) supported the recessive nature of the PI resistance gene whereas the other two crosses (PI 398593 x CNS and PI 398593 x Peking) did not support these findings. From the data available it appears that the resistance is at least partially influenced by the environment. The mode of inheritance of resistance in PI 96983, 'Kwanggyo', 'Toano', 'Jizuka', 'Raiden' and 'Suweon 97' was studied by crossing these cultivars with PMV susceptible cultivars and inoculating the F2 populations of these crosses. In all these cultivars resistance is governed by a single dominant gene. PI 96983, Toano, Jizuka and Suweon 97 were also crossed with York to determine the allelic relationships. Resistance genes in all these cultivars were found to be allelic to Rpv1.

Flutter is a vibration caused by energy in the airstream being absorbed by a non-rigid wing. Active control is one possible method of suppressing flutter. However, due to unmeasurable aerodynamic-lag states, developing an active control using full-state feedback is not viable. The use of a state-estimator is a more practical way of developing active controllers. In this paper we investigate two control methods using state-estimators. We also use simple models of disturbances to test attenuation and robustness of each control method. Finally, a method of quantitative robust analysis is reviewed and then applied to each of the controlled systems.

The Thermal Radiation Group (TRG), a laboratory in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, has been at the edge of technology designing and modeling ERB instruments.  TRG is currently developing a new generation of thermoelectric detectors for ERB applications. These detectors consist of an array of thermocouple junction pairs that are based on a new thermopile technology using materials whose electro-thermophysical properties are not completely characterized.  The objective of this investigation is to design experiments aimed at determining the electro-thermophysical properties of the detector materials. These properties are the thermal conductivity and diffusivity of the materials and the Seebeck coefficient of the thermocouple junctions. Knowledge of these properties will provide fundamental information needed for the development of optimally designed detectors that rigorously meet required design specifications.

This thesis investigates the feasibility of an integrated mining and backfilling system applicable to thin seams. Two conceptual mining systems, namely Auger mining and Self Advancing Miner, have been proposed for this purpose. Both these systems are designed to remotely mine coal from the seams. Several attempts were made in the past to mine coal in a similar fashion but were not very successful due to several problems inherent to thin seams. The lack of effective steering techniques, accurate coal/rock interface and pillar thickness detection techniques were the main shortcomings of the systems. These problems were addressed in the proposed conceptual mining systems. Several coal/rock interface and rib thickness detection techniques currently available in the market or in the prototype stage have been discussed. Recent developments in coal/rock interface detection and direction sensing techniques have good potential in alleviating the previously encountered problems. Sensitivity analyses have been performed to assess the of effect critical mining parameters on the production potential of these systems. The self advancing miner has been found to be more promising than auger mining. Conceptual panels and face layouts for both systems have been included. Two types of filling methods namely pneumatic and hydraulic are considered applicable under thin seam conditions. A backfilling technique using rubber hoses for fill placement can be applied with both methods. Sensitivity analysis have been performed to establish the relationship between face operation cost, filling cost per ton and development cost per foot. Resulting analyses indicate that panel cost per short ton of coal is more sensitive to filling cost than on development cost.

The systems under investigation arise in the numerical solution of quadratic programming problems, for example in the form of Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions or in interior--point methods. Therefore, the system matrix is referred to as a KKT matrix. It is not the purpose of this thesis to investigate systems arising from general quadratic programming problems, but to study systems arising in linear quadratic control problems governed by partial differential equations.  The KKT matrix is symmetric, nonsingular, and indefinite. For the solution of the linear systems generalizations of the conjugate gradient method, MINRES and SYMMLQ, are used. The performance of these iterative solution methods depends on the eigenvalue distribution of the matrix and of the cost of the multiplication of the system matrix with a vector. To increase the performance of these methods, one tries to transform the system to favorably change its eigenvalue distribution. This is called preconditioning and the nonsingular transformation matrices are called preconditioners. Since the overall performance of the iterative methods also depends on the cost of matrix--vector multiplications, the preconditioner has to be constructed so that it can be applied efficiently.  The preconditioners designed in this thesis are positive definite and they maintain the symmetry of the system. For the construction of the preconditioners we strongly exploit the structure of the underlying system. The preconditioners are composed of preconditioners for the submatrices in the KKT system. Therefore, known efficient preconditioners can be readily adapted to this context. The derivation of the preconditioners is motivated by the properties of the KKT matrices arising in optimal control problems. An analysis of the preconditioners is given and various cases which are important for interior point methods are treated separately. The preconditioners are tested on a typical problem, a Neumann boundary control for an elliptic equation. In many important situations the preconditioners substantially reduce the number of iterations needed by the solvers. In some cases, it can even be shown that the number of iterations for the preconditioned system is independent of the refinement of the discretization of the partial differential equation.

This study included these variables and several others in an examination of 64 adolescents and their daily interactions with their parents and how these interactions relate to the overall quality of the relationship. The principal questions of this research were regarding the ability of time with parents, frequency of interactions, quality of interactions, parental affect during the interactions, importance of the relationship, and adolescent gender, to predict the overall quality of relationships between adolescents and their parents. The regression analysis found that parental affect and the frequency of interactions were capable of significant contributions to relationships with both parents. Bivariate analyses reveal many significant relationships between the research variables. The study suggests that these variables, particularly parental affect and the frequency of interactions, merit further attention in the analysis of parent-adolescent relationships. Comparisons between male (N = 25) and female (N = 39) adolescents' relationships were also made. Males spent significantly more time with their fathers and experienced significantly higher ratios of both positive parental affect and positive interactions with their fathers. On average, the adolescents report that the relationships with their parents were important and that overall quality was good. They also reported that 80 to 90% of their interactions were positive.

The purpose of this study is to examine the alcohol and drug abuse, use and dependence of blacks and whites in order to explain the differences in the course of the substance disorder, using data from the National Comorbidity Survey. There are many variables thought to contribute to the racial difference, such as socio-economic status (measured by income and education), religion, insurance, employment status, and marital status. The data in this literature indicate that the aforementioned variables do not explain the racial difference in substance disorders. However, after performing interaction analyses, it is clear that the effects of treatment are different for blacks and whites. Treatment is more effective for whites, and it may even cause the substance disorder to become worse for blacks. Several studies indicate that this may be the result of cultural differences between the treatment staff and the clients.

These regulations have raised concerns in the blue crab industry because processors are now subject to regulations under which new processors are unable to meet the effluent limitations with current processing techniques. This study focuses on the mechanized processing of crab claws. Currently, processors use a brine bath, referred to as the Harris Claw machine, to separate crab claw meat and shell, nd this process yields a waste water which is significantly high in pollutant strength, and is untreatable by biological methods due to the toxicity associated with the high chloride concentrations found in the waste stream. Several alternative crab claw processing systems were developed and evaluated in terms of the meat product yield, the meat product quality, and the wastewater characterization. Two alternatives involved the use of dense media, a 22.5% Staley 1300 corn syrup solution with 5.0% salt and a 30.0% Staley 1300 corn syrup solution, to separate the crab claw meat and shell. These methods, in full scale tests, produced meat yields comparable to that of the brine solution and improved the overall taste of the meat product. However, the effluents had significantly higher BOD5 concentrations. Another alternative to the Harris Claw machine, involved the design, characterization, and testing of a hydraulic separator system (HSS). The HSS was tested on a small scale, but was found to have a meat yield comparable to the Harris Claw machine. The HSS significantly improved the flavor of a final meat product, although the HSS meat product had a significantly lower shelf life than the Harris Claw machine meat product. The waste water quality was improved, because the HSS eliminates the problems associated with a high chloride ion concentration and potentially reduces overall water consumption.

The study looked into finite element factors such as shape functions, mesh refinement, and element distortion.  The study concluded that the higher order shape function eight-node quadrilateral element gave considerably better results than lower order shape function four-node quadrilateral element. The eight-node element converged much faster to the analytical solution than the four-node element. The average error, taking all the cases in consideration, for the four-node element was around 30 % for a mesh refinement of about 14 elements per wavelength at 100 Hz frequency. The eight-node element in the other hand had average absolute errors of less than 1% under the same conditions.  This section also found that the eight-node element was substantially more resistant to solution deterioration due to element distortion than the four-node element. For example distorting the four-node element up to 60* degrees usually increased errors very rapidly to above 100 % errors. The eight-node element on the other hand usually produced errors of less than 5 % for the same level of distortion.  The study showed that the type of boundary condition used had a significant effect on the solution accuracy. The study demonstrated that the effect of the natural boundary conditions was more global. Meeting this kind of boundary condition through mesh convergence produced accurate results throughout the duct.

This investigation is to determine the feasibility of producing such an enclosure for a generator. Several engineering aspects are incorporated in the design of the enclosure. The first, and probably the most paramount, are the acoustical effects of the enclosure itself. The investigation follows the theories for insertion loss of a close fitting enclosure. The thesis examines the system behavior of a close fitting enclosure that most acoustic text books ignore and how the material stiffness, density and source-to-enclosure distance affect the insertion loss and effectiveness of the enclosure. Measured and theoretical sound pressure level around the generator before and after the application of the enclosure are presented using standards described by ISO standard 1344. The second important consideration for the enclosure design involves the heat transfer characteristics. The requirements of cooling air to the generator are discussed. Also presented are some acoustic design considerations to prevent any \"direct line of sight\" to any of the necessary openings which will help in the overall insertion loss. The use of an optimal engineering design technique is presented, demonstrating its strengths and weakness in this application. The optimization method used for the study is the Hooke and Jeeves, or pattern search method. This method solved for the optimum material properties in approximately 30 iterations depending on the initial starting points and the desired weighting parameters.

The steady three-dimensional rotor inlet flow was obtained by a five-hole pneumatic pressure probe, while the one-dimensional rotor exit data were obtained using a piggyback steady/unsteady total pressure probe in non-nulling mode. Both inlet and exit flow conditions were measured in the stationary frame of reference. Results indicate increases in wake thickness and magnitude of total pressure defect as blade loading increased into the distortion cycle. The wake suction side jet increased in width and magnitude as blade loading increased, which appears to be a response to flow blockage caused by the growing boundary layer on the blades. Based on one-dimensional exit total pressure conditions with respect to the distortion screen, the dynamic response of the intra-blade passage flow does not appear to be a function of blade loading, measurement span, or distortion intensity within the ranges tested. Unsteady one-dimensional rotor exit suction side jet width and magnitude varied a great deal within and outside of the distorted region, and were only moderately correlated to inlet flow conditions. Changes in the unsteady one-dimensional rotor wake width and magnitude were usually in phase with and strongly correlated to changes in the inlet flow conditions.

A decrement in an athlete's performance is usually an indicator that overtraining syndrome may be developing. Unfortunately, there is no model that can determine overtraining. A decline in performance results in a depression in maximum muscular force. It is not known whether the force depression is a result of central or peripheral factors. In this study, the two training protocols on different legs determined whether force declines are muscular (peripheral) or psychological (central). Specifically, in this study, the subjects trained one leg at maximal intensity for two weeks, and the other trained at a low intensity for two weeks. After training for two weeks, both legs were placed on a low intensity workout to monitor the recovery process. The purpose of this study was to observe muscle strength performance decrements after overtraining one leg in comparison to properly training the other leg by knee extension exercises for two weeks in trained males. Also, after overtraining the one leg for two weeks, the leg was placed on a reduced training program in order to look at recovery if overtraining occurred. Maximal force output was measured isokinetically on the Biodex three timespre-, post-, and final test. An analysis of this data revealed no significant changes in maximal muscular force output after a high intensity training protocol. Therefore, this investigation demonstrated that overtraining in the quadricep did not result from the two weeks of high intensity resistance training.

The deterioration of the concrete components is a leading cause of the problem. The deterioration of concrete bridge decks is due primarily to corrosion of the reinforcing steel in the concrete. A promising solution to the problem is the use of fiber reinforced plastics (FRP) as a replacement for reinforcing steel. The use of FRP as reinforcement has the following advantages of lightweight, high tensile strength, corrosion resistance, flexibility, and electromagnetic resistance. This paper looks at the use of FRP as reinforcement in concrete beams and compares the information from deflection measurements of different configurations. Also, a material cost comparison is made to determine the cost of using the FRP reinforcement over standard steel reinforcement. Concrete bridge deck systems are designed using steel and fiber-reinforced plastics and allowable stress and load resistance factor methods. Recommendations for further study and uses of FRP are made. ","description-provenance":["ETDs_20110726_kdweeks ","unrestricted ","Made available in DSpace on 2011-08-06T14:37:26Z (GMT).

Additionally, the test stand can measure the voltage and current produced by the fuel cell during operation. Two test stands were constructed and evaluated, one using steam injection for fuel cell stacks and the other using flash evaporation for individual fuel cells. Both test stands were shown to provide adequate control at the upper end of the design range. The flash evaporation test apparatus was used to investigate the effect of inlet gas humidity on fuel cell performance. The results from this investigation showed that, for a fuel cell and reactant temperature of 75°C, the best performance was achieved with a high relative humidity (90%RH) for the hydrogen and a comparatively low relative humidity (60%) for the air.

Although IDS differs from ADS on a variety of measures, most research has focused on various pitch characteristics (i.e., IDS is higher in absolute pitch and more variable in pitch across utterance length). Work from our lab has found that when the pitch characteristics of IDS were held constant, but the temporal features were manipulated, younger (but not older) infants attended more to slower rates of IDS, even though it was unlikely that they had heard such speech (when speech is spoken at this slow rate, the fundamental frequency cannot be maintained). The purpose of this study was to expand our investigation of how speaking rate affects infant attention by adding the physiological measure of heart rate to our protocol. Of specific interest was whether infants would show differential amounts of heart-rate (HR) decelerations as a function of rate (i.e. greater decelerations to slowed speech). 4-month-old infants were tested with normal IDS (unaltered rate) and slow IDS (rate was twice as slow as normal). Behaviorally, infants did not differentially attend to a display as a function of speech type. Psychophysiologically, infants showed more pronounced HR decelerations to slow than to normal IDS. The discrepancy between measures of attention is discussed, especially with regard to the organization of attention in infants of this age.

In addition, the effects of parity and stage of lactation on measures of BMC of the fused 3rd and 4th metacarpal bone and of caudal vertebrae 14 and 15 were assessed. The caudal vertebrae and right front metacarpal (sample pairs) were excised from 107 Holstein cull cows following slaughter. Parity, age, and days in milk (DIM) of the donor animal were obtained for 43 pairs of samples. Samples were grouped by parity (1, 2, 3, and >4) and stage of lactation (Stage 1 = < 90 DIM, Stage 2 = > 90 and < 150 DIM, Stage 3 = >150 and < 250 DIM and Stage 4 = > 250 DIM). Samples were analyzed for BMC and BMD with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), BMC with radiographic photometry (RP), breaking strength with mechanical methods, and mineral content with chemical procedures. Estimates of BMC obtained with RP and DXA were poorly related to chemical measures of actual BMC and to measures of breaking strength. In caudal vertebrae 14 and 15, increasing stage of lactation decreased energy to peak load with the lowest values observed in late lactation. Stage of lactation had no effect on BMC measured chemically in the caudal vertebrae or metacarpal. Parity did not affect breaking strength of the metacarpal or caudal vertebrae or total ash or P content of any bone. Results indicated that imaging techniques are not useful measures of BMC in mature dairy cattle.

This thesis describes the development and testing of a specialized GPS sensor which measures, plots and records real-time high-resolution L1 (1575.42MHz) GPS signal strength at a data rate of up to 10Hz. The instrument is based on an open architecture GPS receiver development kit that can be modified and rebuilt. The signal strength is defined as mean-square signal strength in the thesis. The coarse/acquisition code (C/A-code) correlation is applied and the raw correlation data from a GPS correlator chip is obtained to calculate the signal strength. The gain variation of the automatic gain control (AGC) in the GPS signal link is considered, and a model is designed and implemented in data post-processing to reduce the AGC distortion to GPS signal strength measurements. Speed limitation of 1,000 knots and height limitation of 60,000 feet are removed so that it can track spacecraft such as low earth orbit (LEO) satellite. Four testing plans are developed and conducted to test the GPS signal strength sensor. A GPS simulator is used and the testing results prove that the space-borne sensor is fully operational and the signal strength resolution can be smaller than 0.05dB. Additionally, a COM-port-to-TCP/IP GPS simulation remote control gateway is designed and implemented for the senor and the GPS simulator to conduct formation flying. A graphic user interface (GUI) program is also built to retrieve data from a commercial high-performance space-borne GPS receiver for comparison. A Red Hat Linux signal strength sensor based on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) PiVoT GPS receiver is achieved by modifications. The NASA PiVoT sensor, working together with the former signal strength sensor and the commercial space-borne GPS receiver, will strengthen our academic research strength in the studies on the ionospheric and atmospheric effects and irregularities which cause GPS signal degradation and scintillations.

The debate over racial profiling centers on two questions. Does racial profiling actually occur? If so, is racial profiling being used and is profiling a legitimate tool of law enforcement? There are those who debate whether race is or is not a factor in police discretion and there are those who argue that race is a factor that is appropriate for use in profiling. The purpose of this research is to determine whether race is a significant factor in the likelihood of being involved in a traffic stop. In addition to race, other variables, such as gender and age, are explored as possible control variables. This is done by analyzing data collected by the Bureau of Justice Statistics' \"Contact between Police and the Public\" national survey. By examining several dependent variables that also may be associated with traffic stops, this study determines whether there is or is not a disparity in treatment by race, and whether this is consistent with the alleged purposes of using race in criminal profiles.

I used focus groups (with 5 key stakeholder groups), pre- and post-planning surveys, and interviews. I surveyed VDGIF biologists and managers (N = 21), members of a stakeholders advisory committee (N = 15), and members of 3 constituent groups representing bear hunters (N = 459), beekeepers (N = 442), and environmental interests (N = 500). I interviewed advisory committee members to validate survey results and evaluate the bear management plan. Participation apparently improved constituents' knowledge about bear management and their image of VDGIF bear management, and increased their support for controversial management options (e.g., lethal methods), but did not affect their opinions about bear hunting. Participation apparently had little effect on VDGIF staff opinions about bear management. Knowledge varied widely among constituent organizations. Bear hunting continues to be one of the most central, yet divisive, bear management issues in Virginia. Advisory committee members and VDGIF staff expressed satisfaction with the bear management plan and the planning process. Recommendations for wildlife decision-making processes includebalance science and public values in management, use multiple public involvement techniques, establish collaborative forums among stakeholders, reach out to all stakeholders, and nurture relationships with constituents during implementation.

The tension used to arise from the belligerency between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party. In the past decade, Taiwan increasingly sought to define its own national identity and international status, but faced diplomatic and military pressures from mainland China, which has insisted that Taiwan is part of China. The relationship between mainland China and Taiwan has been one of the most important issues regarding the peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region. In order to explore the Taiwan issue, this research will examine the interactions among the United States, Taiwan, and mainland China in the realist perspective of international relations. The main research questions areWhat determines the costs and benefits of the security decisions of the United States, Taiwan, and mainland China regarding the Taiwan issue? What decisions should the players make based on their costs and benefits? How do these decisions form various scenarios leading to different outcomes? How have the relations among the United States, Taiwan, and mainland China evolved since 1949?   This thesis is organized as follows. First, an examination of the interactions among the three players---the United States, Taiwan and mainland China---in a game theoretical model explores the costs and benefits of their security decisions and the formation of various security scenarios in the Taiwan Strait. Second, the evolution of security in the Taiwan Strait is reviewed and analyzed by applying the game theoretical model to the history of the Taiwan issue. Third, based on the game theoretical model, I make some speculations and predictions on the future relations between mainland China and Taiwan.

This allows the introduction of electronic components such as sensors, actuators and computational devices on the fabrics, creating electronic textiles (e-textiles). E-textiles can be either wearable or non-wearable. However, regardless of their form, e-textiles are placed in a tightly constrained design space requiring high computational performance, limited power consumption, and fault tolerance. The purpose of this research is to create simulation models for power consumption and fault behavior of e-textile applications. For the power consumption model, the power profile of the computational elements must be tracked dynamically based upon the power states of the e-textile components. For the fault behavior model, the physical nature of the e-textile and the faults developed can adversely affect the accuracy of results from the e-textile. Open and short circuit faults can disconnect or drain the battery respectively, affecting both battery life and the performance of the e-textile. This thesis describes the development of both of these models and their interfaces. It then presents simulation results of the performance of an acoustic beamforming e-textile in the presence and absence of faults, using those results to explore the battery life and fault tolerance of several battery configurations.

Feeds were analyzed monthly, and monthly DHIA milk yield, milk composition, milk urea N (MUN), and reproductive data were recorded. Blood and fecal samples were collected from 25 cows/herd every 3 mo to monitor P excretion and blood urea N. Nutrient balances were developed for each farm for N and P at the start of the study and following ration and management changes. Collaborator herds imported, on average, 290% more N and 320% more P onto the farm than was removed through milk, culled animals, crop sales, or manure sales. By following NRC (1989) recommendations, collaborator farms could reduce N inputs by 21% and P inputs by 45%. Minimizing P in purchased feed, purchased feeds/cow, purchased feeds/ha, and total P input could cause significant reductions in P balance for participating collaborator herds. None of the N variables tested (purchased feed, purchased feed/cow, purchased feed/ha, and total N input) provided significant reductions.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a is both secreted by and expressed on the cell-surface (mTNF-a) of macrophages. When stimulated with LPS, tumor-burdened host (TBH) macrophages secrete more TNF-a than normal host (NH) macrophages. In this study, I showed that mTNF-a is elevated both in freshly isolated and stimulated TBH macrophages. Additionally, I analyzed the expression of Fas and FasL on freshly isolated and LPS-stimulated macrophages and found no differences between TBH and NH macrophages. Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) cell-surface expression was analyzed on NH and TBH T-cells. While no difference was observed in freshly isolated cells, cell-surface expression of both proteins remained higher in TBH T-cells than NH T-cells after mitogenic stimulation. Fas and FasL analysis was also extended to the MethKDE fibrosarcoma and I found that these tumor cells express high levels of FasL. Because past observations show increased TNF-a mRNA expression in TBH macrophages relative to NH macrophages, I hypothesized that NF-kB activation may be increased as well. NF-kB is a transcription factor whose activation is required for TNF-a transcription. I observed increased NF-kB activation in both splenic and peritoneal TBH macrophages. Interestingly, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) suggests that different species of NF-kB were found in each distinct population of macrophages. Together, these data demonstrate that cell-surface tumoricidal molecules and NF-kB are dysregulated in the tumor-burdened host.

Main kinds of pseudorotaxanes and rotaxanes and various protocols used for the study of them were discussed first.  By preparation and characterization of a series of pesudorotaxanes based on DB24C8 and paraquat derivatives, it was found that these complexes were stabilized by N+...O interactions, C-H...O hydrogen bonding, and face-to-face p-stacking interactions. Because methyl protons of paraquat are involved in hydrogen bonding to the host, the substitution of any methyl hydrogen on paraquat causes apparent association constant of the pseudorotaxane to decrease.  The concentration dependence of apparent association constants, Ka,exp, of fast exchange host-guest systems was studied for the first time by using complexes based on viologens and crown ethers as examples. While the bis(hexafluorophosphate) salts of paraquat derivatives are predominantly ion paired in acetone (and other low dielectric constant solvents presumably) the complex based on dibenzo-24-crown-8 and paraquat is not ion paired in solution, resulting in concentration dependence of Ka,exp. However, four complexes of two different bis(m-phenylene)-32-crown-10 (BMP32C10) derivatives and bis(p-phenylene)-34-crown-10 (BPP3C10) with viologens are ion paired in solution, as shown by the fact that Ka,exp is not concentration dependent for these systems involving hosts with freer access to bound guests. X-ray crystal structures support these soluton-based assessments in that there is clearly ion pairing of the cationic guest and its PF6- counterions in the solid states of the latter four examples, but not in the former. The complexes based on the new dibenzo-24-crown-8/paraquat recognition motif are thus different from the complexes based on two old recognition motifsthe BPP34C10/BMP32C10-paraquat and DB24C8-ammonium motives.  In order to compare these recognition motives further, the selectivity between two hosts, DB24C8 and BPP34C10, and two guests, dimethyl paraquat and dibenzyl ammnonium salt, was discussed. By individual and competitive complexation studies, it was demonstrated that DB24C8 is a better host than BPP34C10 for paraquat, and that paraquat is a better guest than dibenzyl ammonium salt for DB24C8.  Finally the DB24C8-paraquat recognition motif was successfully applied in the preparation the first star-shaped supramolecular polymer based on a tetraparaquat guest and a DB24C8 functionalized polystyrene oligomer. A model system based on this guest and DB24C8 was also studied for comparison. It was found that the complexation in these two systems is cooperative, as are most biological complexations of multitopic species.

Conventional space-time array processing for narrow-band signals fails in overloaded environments. Overloaded array processing (OAP) is most difficult when signals impinging on the array are near equal power, have tight excess bandwidth, and are of identical signal type. In this thesis, we first demonstrate how OAP is theoretically possible with the joint maximum likelihood (JML) receiver. However, for even a modest number of interfering signals, the JML receiverÃ Â­s computational complexity quickly exceeds the real-time ability of any computer. This thesis proposes an iterative joint detection technique, Spatially Reduced Search Joint Detection, (SRSJD), which approximates the JML receiver while reducing its computational complexity by several orders of magnitude. This complexity reduction is achieved by first exploiting spatial separation between interfering signals with a linear pre-processing stage, and second, performing iterative joint detection with a (possibly) tail-biting and time\"-varying trellis. The algorithm is sub-optimal but is demonstrated to well approximate the optimum receiver in modest signal to interference ratios. SRSJD is shown to demodulate over 2M zero excess bandwidth synchronous QPSK signals with an M element array. Also, this thesis investigates a temporal processing technique similar to SRSJD, Temporally Reduced Search Joint Detection (TRSJD), that separates co-channel, asynchronous, partial response signals. The technique is demonstrated to separate two near equal power QPSK signals with r= .35 root raised-cosine pulse shapes.\" ","description-provenance":["ETDs_20110726_kdweeks ","unrestricted ","Made available in DSpace on 2011-08-06T14:41:44Z (GMT).

Professional boundaries ensure that the needs of clients remain primary. However, boundary transgressions are inevitable. Unfortunately, boundary transgressions have the potential of exploiting clients. Most of what is known about boundary transgressions comes from the perspective of professionals. The literature reiterates the importance of educating the lay public about the dangers of boundary transgressions. This study experimentally examined what effect education specific to boundary transgressions has on the lay public's level of acceptance of boundary transgressions, as opposed to what effect general information about personal/family therapy has on the lay public'­s level of acceptance of boundary transgressions. Two hundred students from a southeastern university participated and read either general information pertaining to personal/family therapy, or specific information pertaining to boundary transgressions, prior to rating their level of acceptance of therapists transgressing boundaries with their clients. Independent sample t-tests determined there were statistical differences in mean ratings of acceptance of boundary transgressions between the groups. However, because the mean scores between the two groups were not much different, the results suggest that the lay public could benefit from a more comprehensive explanation of boundary transgressions.

Horses demonstrating severe pulmonary compromise develop concurrent secondary pulmonary hypertension. The development of pulmonary hypertension is well documented in RAO affected horses, however, it is not known how rapidly increases in pulmonary artery pressure occur after the onset of RAO. It is also not known if pulmonary hypertension resolves concurrently with resolution of RAO. The goal of this study was to measure pulmonary artery pressure in RAO affected horses during the development and resolution of RAO. To accomplish this, three RAO affected and three normal horses were placed in a challenge environment where clinical parameters, pulmonary function, right heart and pulmonary artery pressures were measured on day 1, 3 and 5. After evaluating horses on day five, their environment was modified to reduce exposure to respirable debris and anti-inflammatory medication (dexamethasone) was initiated. Identical clinical parameters were measured on days 7 and 9. In our study, the arterial oxygen content in RAO horses was significantly less that that of control horses from day 1 through day 9. A concurrent increase in pulmonary artery pressure also developed on day 3 in RAO affected horses, and persisted through day 5. While some trend towards a difference between groups was noted, no other significant differences were observed between RAO and normal horses. These findings suggest that horses with severe RAO also develop significant increase in pulmonary artery pressure, which rapidly resolves with appropriate management of RAO.

I argue that white Virginians, faced with the increasing political and social presence of black Virginians as equals, sought to reestablish their racial superiority through law and constitutional revision.

Energy is dissipated during this snap load, and it is proposed to use synthetic fiber ropes as a type of passive earthquake damper in order to take advantage of this phenomenon. This thesis is the second phase of a multi-stage research project whose goal is to investigate and develop what will be known as Snapping-Cable Energy Dissipators (SCEDs). The experimental data that was collected in the Master'­s Thesis of Nicholas Pearson was organized and analyzed as a part of this research in order to evaluate the behavior of the ropes during the snapping action. Additional tests were also conducted for this project under more controlled conditions in order to better understand how the ropes change throughout a sequence of similar snap loadings and also to determine the amount of energy that is dissipated. The data from both projects was then used as input parameters for a mathematical model that was developed to characterize the behavior of the ropes during a snap load.

An understanding of fluvial erosion in mountain belts is fairly well documented, but the impact of glacial erosion is yet to be fully recognized. The uplift of the Chugach-St. Elias Mountains over the last 5-6 Ma under the influence of intense glaciation provides a unique setting to study the impact of glacial erosion on landscape development. The range has been built by rapid convergence (~5 cm/yr) of the Yakutat terrane with North America. Climatic forcing of northward-driven storms has created a disproportionate glacier distribution across strike, where extensive piedmont glaciers (low equilibrium line altitudes) cover the windward side of the range and small isolated glaciers (high equilibrium line altitudes) occupy the leeward side. If glacial erosion is greatest at the equilibrium line altitude, then glaciers will act as \"buzzsaws\" there to limit topographic development. Exhumation would therefore be expected to increase towards the coast. If glacial erosion is not dominant, exhumation would be expected to increase away from the coast towards the core of the range, where fault dip angles are high and deep crustal rocks are exposed.  To determine the impact of long-term glacial erosion on exhumation of the Chugach-St. Elias Mountains, samples were collected along and across the strike of the range and analyzed by the apatite radiogenic helium (AHE) technique. Samples previously dated using the apatite fission track (AFT) method and located adjacent to our field area were also included in the analyses. The low-temperature sensitivity of these thermochronometers allows exhumation rates to be determined for shallow crustal depths. Both glacial and tectonic processes have influenced exhumation of the range. Exhumation rates increase to the south and east towards the collision zone, but coastal rates (0.36-2.5 mm/yr) are significantly higher than inland samples (0.038-0.24 mm/yr). These rates indicate that coastal glaciation plays a dominant role in landscape development and suggest that short-term erosion rates inferred from sediment yields are exaggerated. Although the exhumation rates are lower than expected, the correlation of exhumation patterns, glacier distribution, and equilibrium line altitude supports the \"glacial buzzsaw hypothesis\".

A six-strain cocktail of L. monocytogenes was used to inoculate (approx. 7 log cfu/ml) fruit juices, which were stored at 4, 10 and 24°C for up to 61 days. Inoculated red grape juice was stored for up to 5 hours only. Samples were withdrawn at appropriate intervals, neutralized with 1.0 N NaOH, serially diluted in 0.1% peptone water, and surface plated onto Tryptic Soy Agar + 0.6% Yeast Extract (TSAYE) and Modified Oxford Agar (MOX), followed by incubation at 32°C for 48 hours. When L. monocytogenes was no longer detected by direct plating, samples were enriched for L. monocytogenes using Listeria Enrichment Broth (LEB), followed by isolation on MOX. L. monocytogenes remained viable in white grape, apple, and orange juices for up to 12, 24 and 61 days, respectively. Over time, recovery of Listeria on TSAYE versus MOX was not significantly different (P>0.05), indicating that limited acid-injury developed during storage. The results of this study demonstrate the ability of L. monocytogenes to survive in apple, orange, and white grape juices during refrigerated and abusive storage conditions. Therefore, measures to prevent or eliminate L. monocytogenes in the fruit juice-processing environment are necessary to ensure the safety of juice products for public consumption.

The approach described herein generates tests from a matrix representation of a class interface based on the flow graph concept. In this process, separate matrices for all-DU-pairs and all-nodes guide the generation of the required tests. The primary goal of the research is not to optimize the number of tests generated but to describe the process in a user-friendly manner so that practitioners can utilize it directly, quickly, and efficiently for real-world testing purposes.  The approach has been evaluated to assess its effectiveness at detecting bugs. Both strategies - all-DU-pairs and all-nodes - were compared against three other testing methodsthe commercial white-box testing tool Jtest, Orthogonal Array Testing Strategy (OATS), and test cases generated at random. The five approaches were applied across a sample of eleven java classes selected from java.util.*. Experimental results indicate that the two versions resulting from this research performed on par with or better than their respective equivalent approaches. The all-DU-pairs method performed better than all other approaches except for the random approach, with which it compared equally. Experimental evaluation results thus indicate that an automated approach based on the manual method is worth exploring.

Stream water and sediments were sampled seasonally in two streams of contrasting nitrate availability, Noland Creek (high NO₃-N) and Walker Branch (low NO3-N). Eight additional streams with varying nitrate levels were sampled once during summer. Stream sediments were incubated at ambient stream temperatures, and nitrous oxide accumulation was quantified following acetylene inhibition of nitrous oxide reduction. Denitrification potential was greater in Noland Creek than Walker Branch and was generally greater in sediments from the higher-nitrate streams. In autumn and spring, nitrate and LOC amendments indicated that denitrification potential in Walker Branch sediments was nitrate limited, with temperature having no effect on rates. Denitrification potential in Noland Creek sediments was not limited by nitrate, but temperature had a significant effect. When Noland Creek seasonal data were corrected to a common temperature, no seasonal differences in denitrification potential were detected. Nitrate-N in the 10 surveyed streams ranged from 10 to 549 mg/L, with the highest NO₃-N levels and denitrification rates generally occurring in the higher elevation streams in the GSMNP. We found that nitrate availability, more than LOC availability, controls potential denitrification in these streams.

Wood composites, especially oriented strand board (OSB) are made with many variations of wood species. Little research has been done to investigate how pMDI adhesion has been affected by species.  The present is divided into two parts. First, mode I fracture mechanics and surface free energy analysis was performed to investigate differences in adhesion between southern yellow pine and yellow-poplar bonded with pMDI. Secondly, an improvement in the synthesis of 13C, 15N labeled pMDI is discussed.  Mode I fracture results show that pMDI adhesion was affected differently by southern yellow pine compared yellow poplar. The shear energy release rate was significantly higher in pine/pMDI composites than in yellow poplar/pMDI composites. The total surface energy of southern yellow pine was shown to be significantly greater than yellow poplar. The free energy of adhesion (DG) of the pine/pMDI and the poplar/pMDI was investigated. The DG indicated that the pine/pMDI system would take more energy to separate compared to the poplar/pMDI system. Lastly, a double-labeled 13C, 15N pMDI adhesive was successfully synthesized to produce Solid-State NMR composites.

This estimated \"actuator work,\" or practical work as it will be referred to as in this thesis, is based on the aerodynamic and structural resistance to a control surface deflection. It is meant to represent the actuator energy cost required to deflect a general configuration of conventional or unconventional control surface. Thin airfoil theory is used to predict the aerodynamic load distribution required for this work calculation. The details of applying thin airfoil theory to many different types of control surface arrangements are presented. Convenient equations for the aerodynamic load distributions and aerodynamic coefficients are obtained. Using the developed practical work equations, and considering only the aerodynamic load component, the practical work required for a given change in lift is compared between different control surface arrangements. For single control surface cases, it is found that a quadratic (morphing) trailing edge flap requires less practical work than a linear flap of the same size. As the angle of attack at which the change in lift occurs increases, the benefit of the quadratic flap becomes greater. For multiple control surface cases, it is necessary to determine the set of control deflections that require the minimum practical work for a given change in lift. For small values of the initial angle of attack, it is found that a two-segment quadratic trailing edge flap (MTE) requires more work than a two-segment linear flap (TETAB). But, above a small value of angle of attack, the MTE case becomes superior to the TETAB case. Similar results are found when a 1-DOF static aeroelastic model is included in the calculation. The minimum work control deflections for the aeroelastic cases are shown to be strongly dependent on the dynamic pressure.

In order to schedule a certain category of workers in train stations and selling points, rosters are designed to cover a cyclical demand. However, the highly combinatorial nature of the rostering problem makes it very difficult to solve manually, and experts spend a huge amount of time to derive implementable solutions that improve a number of preference criteria.  This thesis presents two formulations based on mixed-integer programming to adress the cyclical rostering problem. The first one uses variables to express the nature of each day of the roster, whereas the second one uses patterns corresponding to feasible blocks of seven days and assigns them to each week of the roster. Different strategies relative to the management of some preference criteria are compared, some of them leading to significant reductions in computational times. Cuts are finally introduced to improve the bounds obtained by the linear relaxation of the mixed-integer programs. The impact of these cuts on computational times depends much on the problem.

Now we have become the tools for our tools. It is the reaction to this technology that has led our society to become more and more mechanized and engineered, detaching us from the natural processes and the natural phenomena that make up our interesting world. However, because of the landscape'­s potential for communication and demonstration, it is a critical time for landscape architects to use the landscape, highlighting the interaction between the human and natural processes and create a heightened sense of ecological awareness. This thesis design explores how technology can be integrated into the landscape in order to reveal the natural phenomena of wind on the site. The revelation of wind is achieved through the engagement of the airplanes landing and taking off from Reagan National Airport and one's senses as one can hear wind, see wind, feel wind, smell and taste wind. The sensory experience is one that focuses on the overlapping of the senses in a type of synthesia, creating a rich and dynamic fabric for exploration, interpretation and understanding of wind, its movement and its unique cycles.

The making of architecture is inherently most pure when approached as the subtraction of unnecessary elements and a distillation of what is required for a specific program on a particular site. Life is given to structure through habitation; therefore the senses of the inhabitant must be engaged through interaction with the philosophical and tectonic elements of a place. In this didactic, the structure is made complete by its inhabitation and it completes the sensory framing of place by establishing the vantage point of the inhabitant. The confluence of inhabiting space and marking place together result in an architecture of experience.

Customers show up sequentially. When a customer arrives, he will ---depending on the prices---either purchase one unit of type 1 product or one unit of type 2 product, or will leave empty-handed. The sale ends either when the entire stock is sold out, or when the customers are exhausted. The seller's task is to post the optimal prices for the two product types to each customer to maximize the expected total revenue. We use dynamic programming to formulate this problem, and derive the optimal policy for special cases. For general cases, we develop an algorithm to approximate the optimal policy and use numerical examples to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm.  Finally, we apply the results to a continuous-time model where customers arrive according to a Poisson process. We develop a heuristic policy and use numerical examples to show the heuristic policy is very effective.

The key in making an SLDL heterogeneous is the facility to express different Models Of Computation (MOC). Currently, all SystemC models employ a Discrete-Event simulation kernel making it difficult to express most MOCs without specific designer guidelines. This often makes it unnatural to express different MOCs in SystemC. For the simulation framework, this sometimes results in unnecessary delta cycles for models away from the Discrete-Event MOC, hindering the simulation performance of the model. Our goal is to extend SystemC's simulation framework to allow for better modelling expressiveness and efficiency for the Synchronous Data Flow (SDF) MOC. The SDF MOC follows a paradigm where the production and consumption rates of data by a function block are known a priori. These systems are common in Digital Signal Processing applications where relative sample rates are specified for every component. Knowledge of these rates enables the use of static scheduling. When compared to dynamic scheduling of SDF models, we experience a noticeable improvement in simulation efficiency. We implement an extension to the SystemC kernel that exploits such static scheduling for SDF models and propose designer style guidelines for modelers to use this extension. The modelling paradigm becomes more natural to SDF which results to better simulation efficiency. We will distribute our implementation to the SystemC community to demonstrate that SystemC can be a heterogeneous SLDL.

The voice continually evolves as the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth leaves its trace. This voice in its endless variety of forms expresses the beauty that is inherent within each and every location on earth. The potential of architecture is the translation of this voice into human terms and the formal declaration that we as humans play a meaningful part in the cycle. The guiding forms, surfaces, substances of architecture allow the human body to move in grace, unhindered, and inspires the mind to sense the essential connection between matter spirit; between the individual and the whole. The role of the architect is to become sensitive to this voice; to silence the mind enough to hear, and to respond to it in material form. The resulting dialogue between the edifice and the encompassing site reaches a certain completeness that enriches the living experience of the end user, bringing the wandering mind to the present long enough to inspire the thought that \"I belong here, among all of this.\" The technical training required in order to gain an inherent understanding of structure and materials takes years of experience in the field of architecture. However, it has been the focus of my graduate career to further develop this sensitivity to the site and make my first attempts at formulating an architectural response, suggesting structures that could achieve this engagement with the end user and the site itself.

On one hand a very practical concept, that shortend commuting intensively around the complex, but on the other hand the surrounding fabric had no influence and connection to it and the complex could be placed anywhere. That is why I would like to take a closer look at what this building can actually be and stand for while, being a place for education and also use it's design and intentions for part of the education. Thesis QuestionsWhat is the place of education? How can the importance of the school be translated into architecture? What can stuidents learn from the building itself? How is the relationship between the school and the community defined? ","description-provenance":["ETDs_20110726_kdweeks ","unrestricted ","Made available in DSpace on 2011-08-06T14:43:08Z (GMT).

An airplane rarely has one specific mission, and therefore is usually designed as a compromise to meet many flight objectives with a single wing surface. Large-scale shape change of a wing would enable a wing design to be optimized for multiple missions. Engineers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley Research Center are investigating a new Hyper-Elliptic Cambered Span (HECS) wing configuration that may lead to increased stability and control, and to improved aerodynamic efficiency, during flight. However, during take-off and landing, a conventional wing design (not curved down) may be preferred. Thus a need has been developed for a wing whose contour can be changed during flight. The so-called \"morphing\" that is required has been limited by a lack of feasible design solutions. One design concept is to use an adaptive structure, with an airfoil skin applied, as the shape-changing driver. Most designs of this kind require multiple actuators to control the changing shape. This thesis introduces a novel design for a morphing wing mechanism using a single degree-of-freedom kinematic chain. In this work, the concept is introduced with sufficient background to aid in understanding. The design tools developed include a synthesis procedure and a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects of manufacturing errors.

To avoid such damage, designers need a structural system that can dissipate the energy caused by these vibrations. Using elastically buckled struts may be a viable means to reduce the harmful effects of unexpected vibrations. Post-buckled struts can support high axial loads and also act as springs in a passive vibration isolation system by absorbing or dissipating the energy caused by external excitation. When a base excitation is applied, the buckled strut may act to reduce the dynamic force transmitted to the system, thus reducing the structural damage to the system.  Several models of buckled and pre-bent struts are examined with different combinations of parameters and end conditions. The models include pinned or fixed columns supporting loads above their buckling load, and columns with an initial curvature supporting various loads. The varying parameters include external damping, internal damping, and stiffness. The columns will be subjected to simple harmonic motion applied at the base or to a multi-frequency base excitation. The response of each model is measured by the deflection transmissibility of the supported load over a large range of frequencies. Effective models reduce the motion of the supported load over a large range of frequencies.

In 1983, Howard Gardner published his cognitive theory of multiple intelligences. Gardner theorizes that human intelligence is not one single capacity, but is comprised of multiple capacities. Many teachers use the multiple intelligences theory as a tool to reach a larger number of students by engaging their unique learning styles. The theory of multiple intelligences is one way to interpret how an individual might understand, perceive or experience their surroundings. I used Gardner's theory as a framework to develop design criteria that can be used by designers to create landscapes or environments that engage people in an intellectual and meaningful way. By designing a site that will engage different individuals' unique methods of understanding, a landscape architect can create landscapes that will capture attention and promote a unique personal experience through the creation of sense of place. I believe that this in turn can also be used as a tool for articulating design ideas and analyzing current landscapes.  My research begins with a review of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's theory of flow and what is needed to achieve this playful state. The answer is to engage a user with a challenge. This led me to Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences. After a review of his work, I used his theory to analyze several case study landscapes. Based on this research, I developed a set of preliminary design criteria that can be used as an outline or a starting point for designers.  I chose the Joe L. Evins Appalachian Center for Crafts (ACC) in Smithville, Tennessee as my site for beginning my understanding of the range of uses that the multiple intelligences possess within a landscape. The ACC is a visual arts school whose mission is to preserve and educate people about the culture and techniques of Appalachian crafts. The mediums that are taught are clay, glass, metal, fibers, and wood. My design exploration lead me to concluded that the outcome of a multiple intelligences landscape will be shaped by several factorsthe personal strengths and weaknesses within the multiple intelligences of the designer, the sites will determine which intelligences should be designed for, and that the design process should be a collaborative effort. Therefore, the design solution produced is not the strength of this research project, but rather the development, process, and conclusions that reveal a strong case for the inclusion of engaging users' intellectually.

With gigahertz range microprocessors becoming commonplace, it is a typical design requirement to push the speed to its extreme while minimizing power dissipation and die area. Multipliers are critical components of many computational intensive circuits such as real time signal processing and arithmetic systems. The increasing demand in speed for floating-point co-processors, graphic processing units, CDMA systems and DSP chips has shaped the need for high-speed multipliers.  The focus of our research for modern digital systems is two fold. The first one is to analyze a relatively unexplored logic style called MOS Current Mode Logic (MCML), which is a promising logic technique for the design of high performance arithmetic circuits with minimal power dissipation. The second one is to design high-speed arithmetic circuits, in particular, gigahertz-range multipliers that exploit the many attractive features of the MCML logic style. A small library of MCML gates that form the core components of the multiplier were designed and optimized for high-speed operation. The three 8-bit MCML multiplier architectures designed and simulated in TSMC 0.18 mm CMOS technology are3-2-tree architecture with ripple carry adder (Architecture I), 4-2-tree design with ripple carry adder (Architecture II) and 4-2-tree architecture with carry look-ahead adders (Architecture III). Architecture I operates with a maximum throughput of 4.76 GHz (4.76 Billion multiplications per second) and a latency of 3.78 ns. Architecture II has a maximum throughput of 3.3 GHz and a latency of 3 ns and Architecture III has a maximum throughput of 2 GHz and a latency of 3 ns. Architecture I achieves the highest throughput among the three multipliers, but it incurs the largest area and latency, in terms of clock cycle count as well as absolute delay. Although it is difficult to compare the speed of our multipliers with existing ones, due to the use of different technologies and different optimization goals, we believe our multipliers are among the fastest found in contemporary literature.

Specifically, this thesis will provide a simple solution technique for the general case of a two-degree of freedom (2DOF) planetary gear train along with new graphical design aids. It will also address the use of epicyclic gear trains as a power coupling in a tandem bike. In the current literature, planetary gear trains are given a clear treatment with regard to the pure kinematics of the system, but little or no literature exists that includes the torques present in the system. By treating both the kinematics and torque balance of the most general case, this thesis attempts to fill a void in the current literature. After developing the solution to the general two-degree of freedom case using the Willis formula, a force analysis will be performed using the conservation of energy principle assuming zero losses. Once the total solution is known, nomographs will be presented as a simple design tool. These graphical aids enable the designer to simultaneously approximate both speeds and torques for the mechanism. After fully developing a satisfactory solution technique and design tools, these will be applied to the problem of coupling the power provided by the riders of a tandem bicycle.

Based on the gyrostat model, we develop equations that describe the internal torques and forces that occur between the body and one of the attached wheels. We evaluate the transverse torques for the torque--free gyrostat and a gyrostat undergoing attitude maneuvers using momentum wheels and external torques. We then apply these internal forces to a model of an active magnetic bearing system and discuss their effects on the force limit, the actuator slew rate and the equivalent stiffness and damping parameters. As a basis for this study we use the Distributed Spacecraft Attitude Control System Simulator (DSACSS) with a Revolve MBRotor active magnetic bearing system. The results of several numerical simulations show that the magnitude and frequency of the internal torques remain small over the estimated range of motion of the DSACSS--MBRotor gyrostat. As such, the transverse torques caused by the rotational motion remain less than the discussed performance limits. We show that the magnitude of the internal torques can also be minimized by reducing the axial moment of inertia of the wheel. Furthermore, we discuss the equivalent Jeffcott model. By applying a standard Proportional--Integral--Derivative controller to the active magnetic bearing both the equivalent stiffness and damping parameters remain constant.

The biped robot walked on large feet. Having large feet enabled the robot to stand on one leg stably. At any time, the robotÃ Â­s center of gravity remained above the area covered by one of the feet. Two servos actuated the two degrees of freedom tilting the robot to the side or moving the legs forward and backward. The biped moved by alternately tilting and striding. Turns were produced by dragging the feet along the ground. As the feet dragged, the friction generated under the feet created a turning moment that rotated the robot. Thus, the robot was able to step and turn on a flat surface. A control algorithm was developed to attempt trajectory tracking with the biped. Trajectories along a surface can be defined in terms of linear and angular velocities. In this research, it was assumed that a high level controller had transformed a desired trajectory into discrete steps of linear and angular velocities. Motion tests showed how various settings of the servos affected the step length and turning angle of the robot. To produce the desired velocities, a program was created to select the servo commands and set the speed parameters. This program applied knowledge of the expected step length and turning angle and performed feedforward control of the velocities. This investigation identified a trajectory tracking scheme that could be used in an observer feedback scenario to achieve accurate control.

These communication systems demand more data computing, storage, and retrieval capabilities at higher speeds, these demands place a great strain on the power system. To lessen this strain, the existing power architecture must be optimized.  With the arrival of the age of high speed and power hungry microprocessors, the point of load converter has become a necessity. The power delivery architecture has changed from a centralized distribution box delivering an entire system's power to a distributed architecture, in which a common DC bus voltage is distributed and further converted down at the point of load. Two common distributed bus voltages are 12 V for desktop computers and 48 V for telecommunications server applications. As industry strives to design more functionality into each circuit or motherboard, the area available for the point of load converter is continually decreasing. To meet industries demands of more power in smaller sizes power supply designers must increase the converter's switching frequencies. Unfortunately, as the converter switching frequency increases the efficiency is compromised. In particular, the switching, gate drive and body diode related losses proportionally increase with the switching frequency.  This thesis introduces a loss saving self-driven method to drive the secondary side synchronous rectifiers. The loss saving self-driven method introduces two additional transformers that increase the overall footprint of the converter. Also, this thesis proposes a new magnetic integration method to eliminate the need for the two additional gate driver magnetic cores by allowing three discrete power signals to pass through one single magnetic structure. The magnetic integration reduces the overall converter footprint. ","description-provenance":["ETDs_20110726_kdweeks ","unrestricted ","Made available in DSpace on 2011-08-06T14:43:56Z (GMT).

A wireless neural signal recording system is desirable because it removes the cumbersome wires from the animal, allowing it to roam more freely. The result is an animal that is more able to behave as it would in its natural habitat, thus opening the possibility of testing procedures that are not possible with wired recording systems. While there are wireless neural recording systems in existence, this thesis presents a new approach to recording neural signals wirelessly.  The firings of neurons in the hippocampus are manifested as action potentials or voltage \"spikes\" on the order of 100 to 400uV in magnitude. Though the information content of the neural signal is riding on these action potentials, the spikes comprise a small fraction of the complete neural signal. A unique feature of the neural signal transceiver presented in this thesis is its ability to digitally isolate and transmit the action potentials, leaving out the remaining, unimportant part of the neural signal. This approach to recording neural signals makes efficient use of the limited bandwidth available with portable short range wireless devices. This thesis will present the spike isolating neural transmitter, which was built using commercially available electronic components. Then, the proper function of assembly language code written for a PIC18F458 microcontroller will be demonstrated. Finally, a discussion of the performance of the neural signal transmitter will be provided.

The visualizations, which were designed to encourage the students to explore some of the many ways our minds have of knowing and learning, began with a simple relaxation exercise and proceeded to more challenging exercises involving, for instance, kinesthetic learning, sensory awareness, the logical and linguistic mind versus the spatial mind, and intra- and interpersonal intelligence.  Following each visualization the students discussed what they had experienced (transcripts of the visualizations and the discussions are included in the thesis).  The students responded in visual terms as wellafter each visualization, each student created a two- or three-dimensional piece of art from materials such as matboard, construction and origami paper, glue, felt-tip pens, pipe cleaners, and plastic-coated wire. These visual responses have been photographed, described, and scored according to the number of materials used, the number of colors used, and the dimensionality of the piece (photos, descriptions, and scores are included in the \"Gallery\".  I found, surprisingly, that the visualizations in which the students were the most imaginatively engaged did not always produce the most interesting art, and that girls were much less likely than boys to create three-dimensional pieces, although girls tended to use more colors and occasionally used relief on otherwise two-dimensional pieces.

The study objectives were to better understand the relationship between fatigue development during overhead work and task performance. This relationship is important, considering that performance changes, or decreases in task quality, have the potential for justifying and driving ergonomic changes that can help to improve worker safety. Sixteen people participated in eight experimental conditions (two levels of duty cycles, two work heights, and two hand positions). Four dependent measures based on endurance, subjective, objective, and physiological fatigue were used to quantify shoulder fatigue and were collected during the experiment. An overhead work task required participants to use a hand tool to strike targets at two reach distances above their head. Task performance was measured as a function of the closeness to the target center and the ability to apply a consistent force throughout the experiment. Data collected in this experiment is intended to provide a research basis for creating design guidelines that will help maximize efficiency and quality while reducing the likelihood of developing shoulder fatigue.

The basic process to manufacture composite parts is to lay-up raw composite material on a tool and involves very costly means and raw material. This process can be modeled as a two-stage hybrid flow shop problem with specific constraints, particularly prescription constraints on the jobs. This thesis restates the practical problem as a scheduling problem by doing hypotheses and restrictions. Then, it designs a mathematical model based on time-indexed variables. This model has been implemented in an IP solver to solve real based scenarios. A heuristic algorithm is developed for obtaining good solutions quickly. Finally, the heuristic is used to increase the execution speed of the IP solver. This thesis concludes by a discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of each option (IP solver vs. heuristic software) for the sponsor.

Resources join and leave the environment without any prior notification. Application fault detection, checkpointing and restart is of foremost importance in the Grid environments. The need for fault tolerance is especially acute for large parallel applications since the failure rate grows with the number of processors and the duration of the computation.  A Grid job management system hides the heterogeneity of the Grid and the complexity of the Grid protocols from the user. The user submits a job to the Grid job management system and it finds the appropriate resource, submits the job and transfers the output files to the user upon job completion. However, current Grid job management systems do not detect application failures.  The goal of this research is to develop a Grid job management system that can efficiently detect application failures. Failed jobs are restarted either on the same resource or the job is migrated to another resource and restarted. The research also aims to identify the role of local resource managers in the fault detection and migration of Grid applications.

This task is accomplished by using two multi-element arrays and applying direction finding (DF) algorithms on each of them. Rectangular, single-layer, coax-fed patch antennas are used as array elements for the specific purpose of tracking cell phones operating in the PCS band inside a given building. It is vital to ensure that the patch antenna is designed in such a manner that it resonates at the desired frequency. This thesis introduces the Agilent High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) as an effective tool for modeling electromagnetic structures. It presents a comprehensive and meticulous description of the process of modeling a rectangular coax-fed patch antenna in HFSS. Plots of S-parameter values are calculated and are compared with WIPL-D, which is another simulation software program, and with measurements performed at the George Washington University. Various important parameters of the HFSS simulation are varied and their effects are investigated to provide a deeper understanding of the program.

Direct toxicity of three acaricides to TSSM was measured on peanut cuttings. All acaricides caused significant mortality, however; mortality did not differ among the acaricides. Residual toxicities against TSSM were not found to be toxic compared with untreated controls 24 and 72 hours after treatment. When acaricide toxicity to eggs was tested, the hatch rate for all treatments was significantly lower than the control hatch rate.  Direct toxicity of the acaricides was tested against O. insidiosus. Fenpropathrin and propargite caused 100% mortality and etoxazole resulted in mortality > 50%. Residual toxicity of acaricides to O. insidiosus adults varied. Fourteen days after treatment, fenpropathrin left residues highly toxic to O. insidiosus.  In laboratory studies, the functional response of O. insidiosus to TSSM eggs resulted in a Type III response whereas the functional response to adults was Type II. The data suggest either a Type II or linear response in greenhouse studies. A definitive conclusion cannot be drawn because of the sample size.

Diversity techniques play a vital role in supporting such high speed connections over radio channels by mitigating the detrimental effects of multiuser interference and multipath fading. Equal gain combining (EGC) diversity receiver is of practical interest because of its reduced complexity relative to optimum maximal ratio combining scheme while achieving near-optimal performance. Despite this, the literature on EGC receiver performance is meager owing to difficulty in deriving the probability density function of the diversity combiner output. This problem is further compounded when the diversity paths are correlated.  Since spatial, pattern, or polarization diversity implementations at a mobile handset are usually limited to a small diversity order with closely spaced antenna elements (owing to cost and ergonomic constraints), any performance analysis must be revamped to account for the effects of branch correlation between the combined signals. This thesis presents a powerful characteristic function method for evaluating the performance of a two-branch EGC receiver in Nakagami-m channels with non-independent and non-identical fading statistics. The proposed framework facilitates efficient error probability analysis for a broad range of modulation/detection schemes in a unified manner.  The thesis also examines the efficacy of an average diversity combiner in slotted direct sequence spread-spectrum access packet radio networks. A two-dimensional EGC diversity combining scheme is introduced, wherein a corrupted packet is retained and combined with its retransmission at the bit level to produce a more reliable packet. The mathematical analysis of the average diversity combiner presented in this thesis is sufficiently general to handle generalized fading channel models with independent fading statistics for a myriad of digital modulation schemes.

For this wing, the leading and trailing edges are swept back according to a hyper-elliptical equation. The span of the wing is also defined with hyper-elliptical anhedral giving it nonplanar spanwise camber. A single-degree-of-freedom mechanism is developed to provide a means for the wing to continuously change shape from its nonplanar to planar configuration. The mechanism uses a repeating quaternary-binary link configuration to translate motion from one segment to the next. A synthesis of the mechanism is performed, such that with one input to the first segment of the chain, the other wing segments move into their desired positions. Linear aerodynamic theory is applied to the HECS wing configuration at certain morphed positions in order to predict the aerodynamic loads.  This work performs a linear static analysis of the mechanism at different morphed positions. A finite element representation of the mechanism as a structure is developed. Using the predicted aerodynamic loads, a structural analysis is performed. The analysis investigates different materials and cross sections of the members to determine a need for redesign due to failure from buckling and bending stress. From the analysis of the mechanism, a design is finalized which lightens the structure as well as increases the strength. These results are beneficial for the next phase of model development of the mechanism.

Multi-functional, low molecular weight phenol-formaldehyde novolac resins were blended with these novel phthalonitrile derivatives to achieve low viscosity resin blends.  Moderate temperatures and rapid curing cycles were employed (200 ÂºC, 1 h and 225 ÂºC, 4h) to produce networks with high glass transition temperatures (> 250 ÂºC).  A decrease in the sharp band at 2230 cm-1, attributed to the nitrile functionality of the phthalonitrile resin, was monitored in FTIR studies and indicated the progress of the reactions.  Ninety percent conversion was achieved within ~ 30 min.    Thermal analysis of siloxane-phthalonitrile/novolac networks cured for 1h at 200 ÂºC and 4h at 225 ÂºC did not exhibit glass transition temperatures below 250 ÂºC.  In dynamic TGA studies, 5% weight loss temperatures up to 418 ÂºC were observed, and the materials exhibited 50 to 56 % char at 800 ÂºC in nitrogen.  Networks prepared from a resin blend containing 50 weight% of a phthalonitrile derivative of a 260 g mol-1 novolac oligomer, 50 weight% of the 260 g mol-1 novolac oligomer, and 1.5 mol % triphenylphosphine (based on novolac) (NOV/NOV/TPP) cured at 200 ÂºC for 1h, did not exhibit a Tg below 250 ÂºC via DSC.  These networks exhibited a 5% weight loss temperature of 350 ÂºC, and 70 % char at 800 ÂºC in TGA studies under nitrogen.  This degree of char formation makes these materials appealing for use in carbon-carbon composites.  Post-curing these networks at 200 ÂºC for 1h, and then at 225 ÂºC for 4h, resulted in high thermo-oxidative stability, with a 5% weight loss observed at 447 ÂºC and 50 % char at 800 ÂºC.    Blending tetramethyldisiloxane phthalonitrile monomers with 260 g mol-1 novolac oligomers afforded prepolymer resins with low melt viscosities, 560 mPa s at 80 ÂºC.  Such viscosities may allow these resins to be processed via vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) at low temperatures and heated at elevated temperatures to produce flame resistant three-dimensional networks.

This thesis presents a unified analytical framework to perform a trade-off study for a class of hybrid generalized selection combining technique for ultra-wideband, spread-spectrum and millimeter-wave communication receiver designs. The thesis also develops an exact mathematical framework to analyze the performance of a dual-diversity equal gain combining (EGC) receiver in correlated Nakagami-m channels, which had defied a simple solution in the past. The framework facilitates efficient evaluation of the mean and variance of coherent EGC output signal-to-noise ratio, outage probability and average symbol error probability for a broad range of digital modulation schemes. A comprehensive study of various dual-diversity techniques with non-independent and non-identical fading statistics is also presented.  Finally, the thesis develops some closed-form solutions for a few integrals involving the generalized Marcum Q-function. Integrals of these types often arise in the analysis of multichannel diversity reception of differentially coherent and noncoherent digital communications over Nakagami-m channels.

This research attempts to take advantage of the chemomechanical and chemoelectrical coupling by characterizing the transient response as the polymer undergoes an ion exchange, thus using the polymer for ionic sensing. Nafionâ ¢ is a biocompatible material, and an implantable polymeric ion sensor which has applications in the biomedical field for bone healing research. An ion sensor and a strain gauge could determine the effects of motion allowed at the fracture site, thus improving rehabilitation procedures for bone fractures.  The charge sensitivity of the material and the capacitance of the material were analyzed to determine the transient response. Both measures indicate a change when immersed in ionic salt solutions. It is demonstrated that measuring the capacitance is the best indicator of an ion exchange. Relative to a flat response in deionized water (±2%), the capacitance of the polymer exhibits an exponential decay of ~25% of its peak when placed in a salt solution. A linear correlation between the time constant of the decay and the ionic size of the exchanging ion was developed that could reasonably predict a diffusing ion. Tests using an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) indicate that 90% of the exchange occurs in the first 20 minutes, shown by both capacitance decay and an atomic level scan. The diffusion rate time constant was found to within 0.3% of the capacitance time constant, confirming the ability of capacitance to measure ion exchange.

The solid phase was partitioned into two operationally defined size fractions; colloidal matter was defined as organic carbon (OC) retained by a 30 kilodalton ultrafiltration membrane, and particulate matter was defined as OC retained by a 1μm glass-fiber filter. Coagulation pH had a considerable impact on residual OC colloid formation, signified by more colloids formed as a function of alum dose at pH 6.8 as compared to pH 5.8. Initial NOM concentration strongly influenced the alum dose range over which OC colloid formation occurred and was found to be a proportional relationship. The presence of bentonite clay (used as the initial turbidity source) somewhat affected OC colloid formation by exerting some amount of coagulant demand, signified by decreasing OC colloid formation with increasing initial turbidity. Coagulation temperature had a considerable impact on particulate matter formation, as there was an increase in the dose at which particle formation first occurred at 4 ºC when compared to 25 ºC. Phase separation of OC from dissolved to colloidal matter was very similar at both 4 ºC and 25 ºC. The ability for low doses of polymers to replace a large portion of alum in order to further aggregate colloids during flocculation was unsuccessfully investigated. OC phase separation resulting from alum and iron sulfate coagulation was compared on a molar coagulant metal basis. The amount of residual OC associated with colloidal matter was similar, while the critical coagulant dose at which particulate matter formed was shifted to a much higher dose for iron.

The experiments focus on near-wall flow field measurements for the stationary wall and moving wall, and static pressure measurement on the low end-wall for the stationary wall case. The representative flows were pressure driven, three-dimensional turbulent boundary layers in the linear cascade tunnel for the stationary wall case, and the combination of the pressure driven and shear driven flow for the moving wall case.  Several experimental techniques are used in the studiesa three-orthogonal-velocity-component fiber-optic laser Doppler anemometer (3D-LDA) system, surface oil flow visualization, and a scanivalve system for static pressure measurement through pressure ports on the end-wall. From the details of the oil flow visualization pattern on the end-wall, some features of the passage flow, cross flow, and the tip leakage vortex in this cascade flow were captured. Oil flow visualization on the blade surface reveals the reattachment of the tip leakage vortex on the blade surface. The static pressure results on the lower end-wall and mid-span of the blade show huge pressure drop on the lower end-wall from the pressure side to the suction side of the blade and from mid-span to the lower end wall. The end-wall skin friction velocity is calculated from near-wall LDA data and pressure gradient data using the near-wall momentum equation. The statistics of Reynolds stresses and triple products in two-dimensional turbulent boundary layer and three-dimensional turbulent boundary layer was examined using a velocity fluctuation octant analysis in three different coordinates (the wall collateral coordinates, the mid tip gap coordinates, and the local mean flow angle coordinates). The velocity fluctuation octant analysis for the two-dimensional turbulent boundary layer reveals that ejections of the low speed streaks outward from the wall and the sweeps of high speed streaks inward toward the wall are the dominant coherent motions. The octant analysis for the three-dimensional turbulent boundary layer in the tip gap shows that the dominant octant events are partially different from those in the two-dimensional turbulent boundary layer, but ejection and sweep motions are still the dominant coherent motions. For the three-dimensional turbulent boundary layer in the moving wall flow, the near-wall shear flow reinforces the sweep motion to the moving wall and weakens the out-ward ejection motion in the shear flow dominant region. Between the passage flow and the shear flow, is the interaction region of the high speed streaks and the low speed streaks. This is the first time that the coherent structure of the three-dimensional turbulent boundary in the linear cascade tip gap has been studied.

Work (or energy) is required to create new surface area—with associated dissipation events—during fracture, and this energy (for a given material system) is dependent on the speed of crack propagation, the locus of failure, and the temperature of the bond when it is broken. Since the 90° peel test has been widely employed in quasi-static fracture testing of film adhesion for printed circuit board applications, this test was first used as a basis to which other test results could be compared. A test fixture was designed and built for quasi-static peel testing that accommodated peeling at different angles and temperatures. A similar test was then desirable for the direct comparison of dynamic fracture events to those quasi-static results. The “loop peel test” was thus developed to mimic the common 90° peel test and to quantify the time- and temperature-dependent fracture energies of peel specimens during low-velocity impact. This test has been successfully used to determine the apparent critical strain energy release rate of copper/epoxy bonds for low-velocity impact conditions (1-10 m/s), for a case of near-interfacial failure. The falling wedge test has also been adapted to estimate the apparent critical strain energy release rate at similar fracture conditions. Four types of printed circuit boards have been analyzed with the above impact test methods as well as with their corresponding quasi-static tests, and the fracture energies measured with the impact tests have been compared to those obtained using quasi-static tests. Fracture energies of the material systems considered were dependent on time (speed of fracture), temperature, and the amount of moisture migration, as determined via humidity conditioning parameters.

The procedural approach is often ill suited for complex systems that need to integrate with other codes. Furthermore, these legacy systems are usually written in FORTRAN, for which there is increasingly less personnel available compared to, say, C++. While it would be desirable to convert these legacy systems into object-oriented codes described in C++, such a conversion process is nontrivial. Currently, the structural design must be manually examined, interpreted, and converted into an object-oriented design described in an object-oriented language. Therefore, the conversion process is likely to introduce numerous new inconsistencies and errors, which degrades the software's quality and increases its costs.  The preferred solution would be to automate this conversion process. Automation would promote consistency by eliminating the manual variations in interpretation and implementation. It would therefore maximize the likelihood that the converted code does not introduce new errors relative to the original code.  The work presented here automates the conversion process from procedural design described in the FORTRAN77 language into object-oriented design described in the C++ language. It demonstrates the extraction of object-oriented elements using FORTRAN common block structures and FORTRAN subroutine and function-calling hierarchies. The result is a consistent, first-cut converted design, which enhances cohesion within classes and reduces coupling between classes. This result is described in the contemporary, broadly used computer language C++, which integrates with adjacent modules that might still remain procedural and described in FORTRAN.

However these dependencies are important, especially for applications where both cooling and power losses are driven by complex mechanisms. For a power supply system, a dynamic design process is necessary to address both electrical and thermal issues. It is because the steady state temperatures of the system are obtained from loss-and-temperature iteration. Once a system solid body model is built, iterations between power loss and junction temperature calculations are performed to obtain the steady state temperature distribution. Since reliability and failure rate of components are directly related to temperatures, an accurate model is critical to provide proper thermal management, which achieves maximum power density. All cooling-related data such as placement of components, airflow rate, heat sink size, and device types are subjected to design changes in order to meet ultimately the temperature requirements. The goal of this thesis is to demonstrate the benefits of integrated analysis and design tools applied in distributed power supply systems designs. First, it will significantly speed up the design process and eliminate the errors resulting from repeated manual data entry and information exchange. Second, the integrated electrical-thermal design tools encompass electrical, thermal, layout, and packaging design to obtain the optimal system design.

Most of the projects still have only one purposethey are either reserved for conservation as are the great national parks, or are planned for recreation or development that ignores natural systems.  \"Most...landscape designers are still inspired by and primarily focused on aesthetics; society's other major objectives are secondary for them\" (Richard Forman 2002, p85).  In 1993, American Society of Landscape Architects defined sustainable development as, \"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the future.\" Thus designers need to understand how natural and human systems work and design for the protection of our environmental as an integral part of any development.  Landscape architects can achieve this by borrowing principles of legendary works like the \"Emerald Necklace\" and combining those with new technology to meet changing cultural and ecological needs. This thesis asserts that sustainable development should be achieved by reconciling human systems and its effects on the surrounding environment by using and revealing natural systems to spread consciousness and earn attention and care for our environment.  Suitability analysis by Ian McHarg, Bioregionalism by Clair Reiniger, Regenerative design process by Lyle, and Framework for ecological design by Prof. Carl Steinitz are various design processes to create developments, which can respond to both natural and human needs.  The thesis project, Riverside Park and Biomedical Complex in the South Jefferson Redevelopment Area in Roanoke, VA, explores how a design process, consisted of framework for ecological design and principals of eco-revelatory design, can help to plan a sustainable development, which uses and reveals natural systems to reconciling human systems and its effects on the surrounding environment. The project demonstrates how a multidisciplinary approach towards landscape design can help to create a multifunctional design that meets the, ecological and cultural, needs of the present without compromising the future.

Fatigue measures included several EMG based parameters and subjective discomfort ratings through use of the Borg CR-10 scale. This study was part of a larger existing study that simulates overhead work in an automobile manufacturing plant. Ten participants used a drill tool to perform an overhead tapping task for one hour at a height relative to individual anthropometry. Reliability indexes, including Intraclass Correlation Coefficients, Standard Errors of Measurement, and Coefficients of Variation were determined for each fatigue measure for each of three shoulder muscles (anterior deltoid, middle deltoid, and trapezius). High reliability implies repeatable results, and precise and credible methods. Conversely, measurement error and subject variability can lead to low reliability of measures.  The results indicated that ratings of perceived discomfort (RPD) parameters (slope and final rating) showed relatively high reliability. Intercepts for mean power frequency (MnPF), median power frequency (MdPF), and root means square (RMS) also showed very high reliability. Actual slopes for MnPF, MdPF, and RMS showed low reliability overall, and normalizing slopes did not necessarily improve reliability. Taking the absolute value of slopes led to a noticeable increase in reliability. RPD slope did not correlate with any of the EMG slopes. The high reliability of RPD parameters allows for its inexpensive application to the industrial setting for similar overhead tasks. The reliability of EMG intercepts implies consistent methods; however the reliability of overall EMG trends is suspect if the slope is not reliable. Some EMG slope parameters show promise; however, more research is needed to determine if these parameters are reliable for complex tasks.

A limitation of current systems is the relatively small amount of reconfigurable hardware resources. Many algorithms require more hardware resources than are available. One solution to this problem is runtime reconfiguration (RTR). Using RTR techniques, a large algorithm is implemented as a collection of configurations for the reconfigurable hardware. These configurations are loaded onto the reconfigurable hardware as necessary to implement the algorithm. A primary limitation of RTR is that the reconfiguration process is slow. Therefore, methods of decreasing reconfiguration time are desirable.  Another method of implementing large algorithms on small hardware is to use multiple configurable computing platforms connected via a communication network. RTR techniques can be used in conjunction with this method to further increase hardware availability. In this case reconfiguration time is increased by the overhead of transmitting data across the communication network. Methods of decreasing network overhead are desirable.  This thesis discusses the use of caching techniques to decrease reconfiguration time. An architecture for caching configurations is implemented on a configurable computing system platform. The use of caching to decrease network overhead is discussed and exhibited. An example application is implemented and used to evaluate the effects of caching on reconfiguration time and algorithm performance.

The benefits to this design include a reduction in overhead incurred by synchronization, communication, and memory accesses. To properly determine its effectiveness, the SCMP architecture must be exercised under a wide variety of workloads, creating the need for a variety of applications. A compiler can relieve the time spent developing these applications by allowing the use of languages such as C and Fortran. However, compiler development is a research area in its own right, requiring extensive knowledge of the architecture to make good use of its resources. This thesis presents the design and implementation of a compiler for the SCMP architecture. The thesis includes an in-depth analysis of SCMP and the necessary design choices for an effective compiler using the SUIF and MachSUIF toolsets. Two optimizations passes are included in the discussionpartial redundancy elimination and instruction scheduling. While these optimizations are not specific to parallel computing, architectural considerations must still be made to properly implement the algorithms within the SCMP compiler. These optimizations yield an overall reduction in execution time of 15-36%.

The research further uses known inventory performance parameters to performance benchmark the VMI system with traditional push-pull systems, develop a collaborative forecasting spreadsheet solution and a best alternative ordering policy amongst EOQ, Monthly, JIT and VMI policies under known lead time and a variety of demand distribution functions.

An analysis was conducted on 10 bridge decks built in the state of Virginia between the years 1981 and 1995.  A total of 141 cores containing either ECR or bare steel were evaluated. A chloride solution was applied to the surface on a weekly cycle (for a total duration of 3.06 years) and a nondestructive electrochemical testing was performed on each core on a monthly cycle. Cores were also inspected for surface cracks, the thermal properties of the epoxy coating, and the concrete conditions at bar depth. The concrete was tested for saturation percentages, diffusion coefficients, and chloride contents, while the epoxy was tested for its glass transition temperature, moisture content, and amount of surface cracking. The results indicate that the best predictor for estimating the times to corrosion initiation and cracking is the amount of chlorides present in the concrete encasing the ECR. The presence of chloride ions will have a determining effect on corrosion regardless of the epoxy coating condition. As a result, it is likely that ECR is not the solution to corrosion prevention and it is recommended that closer attention be given to improving concrete conditions that reduce the diffusion of chloride ions. The conclusion that ECR is an unreliable corrosion prevention method is in agreement with the results of previous studies.

A detection and warning system has been devised and implemented at a no-passing zone site on route 114 of Southwest Virginia to address this problem. The warning system aims at deterring drivers from illegally conducting a passing maneuver within the no-passing zone area. The violating driver is warned in real time to stop the illegal act. This system is currently operational and its main function is to warn the no-passing zone violator. The aim of this research is to extend the warning system to the opposing vehicle in the same lane of the persistent violator in order to avoid crashes caused by the illegal maneuver that is taking place at a crest vertical curve of the two-lane rural road. In order to test the new system prior to its physical installation, a computer simulation has been developed to represent the real world violation conditions so that a better understanding of the problem and its varying scenarios would be achieved. The new simulation, which is the focus of this thesis, takes advantage of an existing simulation developed earlier to replicate only the illegal maneuver without giving any warnings to the opposing vehicle. The new program simulates the outcome of deploying a warning sign to the opposing driver for crash avoidance purposes assuming that all violators persist to pass the vehicle ahead. More than 712,000 computer runs were conducted to simulate the various possible outcomes including the sensitivity analysis. A critical comparison was made between the previous system that warned only the violating vehicle and the current program that warns both the violator as well as the opposing vehicle. The results indicate that warning the opposing driver would reduce the rate of unavoidable crashes by approximately 11% in the east direction and 13.25% in the west direction.

The SCIIB fiber optic temperature sensor system shows us an innovative fiber optic sensor system compared with traditional fiber optic sensors. In addition to the general benefits of the traditional fiber optic sensors, the SCIIB fiber optic sensor system possesses several unique advantages. By taking advantage of the Split-Spectrum technique developed in Photonics Lab at Virginia Tech, the SCIIB sensor technology possesses the capability of Self-Calibration that can fully compensate for the fluctuation of optical source power and the variations of fiber losses. It combines the advantages of both the interferometric-based and the intensity-based fiber optic sensors in a single system. A multimode fiber-based SCIIB temperature sensor system is designed and successfully implemented. Comprehensive experiments are performed to evaluate the principle of SCIIB technology and the performance of the multimode fiber-based SCIIB temperature sensor system. The experiment results illustrate that the development of the SCIIB fiber optic temperature sensor system provides a reliable tool for the temperature measurement capable of operation in high temperature harsh environments.

Previous studies suggested that TCDD exerted immunotoxic effects only on cells differentiating in response to antigenic challenge. To this date, no work has been done to characterize the long-term effects of TCDD on the activated cells. Additionally, no studies have been done to determine whether TCDD has any effect on resting T cells. In the current study, therefore, we investigated the effects of TCDD on activated and resting cells within the same animal. T cells in the popliteal lymph node cells were activated by rear footpad immunizations with anti-CD3 antibodies. Distally-located axillary lymph nodes were chosen as a source of naive and resting T cells. Our results demonstrate that TCDD acted at the time of cell differentiation to suppress the immune responses of activated T cells, but failed to suppress, and at times, enhanced the immune responses of resting T cells. The TCDD-induced immunomodulations were temporary; responsiveness of both activated and resting T cells from TCDD-treated animals returned to normal by two weeks post-treatment, suggesting that TCDD does not affect memory cells. Futhermore, we provide direct evidence that the TCDD-induced immunosuppression in activated cells is due to increased apoptosis of CD3+ T cells. TCDD also induced significant changes in cell surface markers expressed by naive and activated T cells. Together our data suggested that TCDD suppresses the proliferative responsiveness of only the activated, but not naive, T cells and that this is accomplished by induction of increased apoptosis of activated T cells.

Planned lead-time (PLT) and lot size are two of the input parameters for MRP systems, which determine planned order release dates. Presently, planned lead-time and lot size are estimated using independent methodologies. No existing PLT estimation methods consider factors such as machine breakdown, scrap-rate, etc. Moreover, they do not consider the capacity of a shop, which changes dynamically, because the available capacity at any given time is determined by the loading of the shop at that time. The absence of such factors in calculations leads to a huge lead-time difference between the actual lead-time and PLT, i.e., lead-time error. Altering the size of a lot will have an effect not only on the lead-time of that lot but also on that of other lots. The estimation of lot size and lead-time using independent methodologies currently does not completely capture the inter-dependent nature of lead-time and lot size. In this research, a lot-sizing model is modified in such a way that it minimizes the combination of setup cost, holding cost and work-in-process cost. This proposed approach embeds an optimization routine, which is based on dynamic programming on a manufacturing system model, which is based on open queuing network theory. Then, it optimizes lot size by using realistic estimates of WIP and the lead-time of different lots simultaneously for single-product, single-level bills of material. Experiments are conducted to compare the performance of the production plans generated by applying both conventional and the proposed methods. The results show that the proposed method has great potential and it can save up to 38% of total cost and minimize lead-time error up to 72%.

An analytical model is first used to compare passive two degree of freedom (2DOF) absorbers to SDOF absorbers using point impedance as the performance criterion. The results show that one 2DOF absorber can provide the same impedance at two resonance frequencies as two SDOF absorbers for equal amounts of total mass. Experimental testing on a composite cylindrical shell supports the assertion that a 2DOF absorber can attenuate two resonance frequencies. Further modeling shows that MDOF absorbers can utilize the multiple mode shapes that correspond to their multiple resonance frequencies to couple into modes of a distributed primary system to improve the attenuation of structural resonance. By choosing the coupling positions of the MDOF absorber such that its mode shape mirrors that of the primary system, the mass of the absorber can be utilized at multiple resonance frequencies. For limited ranges of targeted resonance frequencies, this technique can result in MDOF absorbers providing attenuation equivalent to SDOF absorbers while using less mass. The advantage gained with the MDOF absorbers is dependent on the primary system. This work compares the advantage gained using the MDOF absorbers for three primary systemsMDOF lumped parameter systems, a pinned-pinned plate, and a cylindrical shell.  The active vibration absorber study in this work is highly motivated by the desire to reduce structural vibration in a rocket payload fairing. Since the efficiency of acoustic foam is very poor at low frequencies, the target bandwidth was 50 to 200 Hz. A 2DOF active vibration absorber was desired to exhibit broad resonance characteristics over this frequency band. An analytical model was developed to facilitate the design of the mechanical and electrical properties of the 2DOF active vibration absorber, and is supported by experimental data. Eight active vibration absorbers were then constructed and used in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) feed-forward control system on a mock payload fairing under high level acoustic excitation. The results show significant levels of global attenuation within the targeted frequency band.

Objectives of this study were1. to determine whether selection for toxicosis response had also caused divergence between lines in hepatic Phase I enzyme activity (as assessed by sleep time following sodium pentobarbital anesthesia), 2. to determine whether sleep time differences between lines were modulated by fescue toxins or enzyme inducers in the diet, and 3. to determine whether sleep time differences among individual mice were correlated with the impact of a toxin-containing diet on their post-weaning growth.  In experiment 1, five dietary treatments were assigned to 24 male mice in each linerodent food control, E+ (50% endophyte-infected fescue seed, 50% control), E+P (E+ with 1000 ppm phenobarbital), E- (50% endophyte-free fescue seed, 50% control), and E-P (E- with 1000 ppm phenobarbital). After four weeks on these diets, mice were challenged with a sleep time test. All mice were then switched to a pelleted rodent food diet. Each mouse then received a second sleep time test, a random 1/4 of the population after one, two, three, and four weeks on the standard diet. Results demonstrated that, regardless of dietary treatment, R mice had a shorter sleep time than S mice, suggesting higher activity of liver Phase I microsomal enzymes. Mice that were fed phenobarbital had significantly shorter sleep time than those whose diets did not include this microsomal enzyme inducer. Time interval between the first and second sleep time did not significantly impact the second sleep time, confirming line differences in the absence of toxins and inducers and with advancing age. In experiment 2, male and female R and S mice were fed an E- diet for 2 weeks, then an E+ diet for 2 weeks, followed by a pelleted rodent food diet for 2 weeks. Mice were then administered a sleep time test. Their growth rate response to fescue toxicosis was quantified as the proportional reduction in gain during two weeks on the E+ diet, compared to gain on E- during the previous two weeks. Sleep time was significantly influenced by line but not by sex or the line x sex interaction. As in Experiment 1, S mice slept longer than their R counterparts. The residual correlation between reduction in gain associated with the E+ diet and sleep time was only 0.04. Thus, under these experimental conditions an individual animal's Phase 1 enzyme activity did not predict how severely its growth rate would be depressed by a toxin-containing diet.  Based upon these and previous studies, divergent selection for toxicosis response in mice was successful partially by causing divergence between lines both in Phase I and Phase II liver detoxification enzyme activities. If a heritable, practical, and economical criterion could be identified to quantify such differences in livestock species, then selection for toxicosis resistance might contribute to the solution of this important problem for American agriculture.

Although this pest occurs on both landscape and nursery stock as well as in natural stands of hemlock forest, pesticides are only practical and effective in urban settings. Ecological and economical considerations prevent utilization of chemical treatment in the forest setting, thus biological control is viewed as the most promising option for slowing the spread of HWA. It is essential for researchers to be able to accurately assess the population levels of biocontrol agents after release into the environment. No method currently exists for sampling HWA predators. This project was designed to determine whether two species of predators are able to utilize olfactory cues from eastern hemlock and/or HWA in host-finding. If predators use olfactory cues, we may develop an attractive sythnetic blend of compounds to draw them to a trap, thereby simplifying the sampling and improving its accuracy. To address this question we executed three experiments. The first involved examination of the antennae of the predators for the presence and abundance of olfactory sensilla. The second experiment was designed to detect a behavioral response by the predators following exposure to host volatile compounds. The final experiment involved identifying compounds emitted from eastern hemlock, and the affect of HWA-feeding on volatile emissions. Laricobius nigrinus Fender (ColeopteraDerodontidae) antennae are densely populated with sensilla, several of which are potentially olfactory in function. In addition, we observed a behavioral response to olfactory cues which included altered flight behavior. However, the behavior was not clearly attraction. Pseudoscymnus tsugae Sasaji and McClure (ColeopteraCoccinellidae) has few sensilla on a very short antennae and only one type of sensilla possesses wall pores suggestive of an olfactory function. In addition, we did not observe a significant behavioral response to host-volatiles. It seems unlikely that this species uses olfaction in long-range host location. We identified 10 monoterpenes that were consistently expressed in the hemlock volatile profile and were unable to isolate volatile emissions from HWA. There is an increased monoterpene release rate from HWA-infested hemlock foliage as compared to uninfested foliage apparently driven indirectly by HWA through a reduction in new growth at branch tips. In addition there was a slight but statistically significant change in the percent composition of the individual compounds.  We see potential in developing a more efficient sampling procedure for L. nigrinus through utilization of olfactory cues. More biological assays must be conducted to determine whether an attractive blend exists and electrophysiological assays are required to isolate physiologically active compounds. However, our data suggest that P. tsugae is not likely to be reliant on olfaction in long-range host location.

Container cranes are used extensively in ship-to-port and port-to-ship transfer operations. In this work, we will extend the recently developed delayed position feedback controller to container cranes. In contrast with traditional work, which models a crane as a simple pendulum consisting of a hoisting cable and a lumped mass at its end, we have modeled the crane as a four-bar mechanism.  The actual configuration of the hoisting mechanism is significantly different from a simple pendulum. It consists typically of a set of four hoisting cables attached to four different points on the trolley and to four points on a spreader bar. The spreader bar is used to lift the containers. Therefore, the dynamics of hoisting assemblies of large container cranes are different from that of a simple pendulum. We found that a controller which treats the system as a four-bar mechanism has an improved response. We developed a controller to meet the following requirementstraverse an 80-ton payload 50 m in 21.5 s, including raising the payload 15 m at the beginning and lowering the payload 15 m at the end of motion, while reducing the sway to 50 mm within 5.0 s at the end of the transfer maneuver. The performance of the controller has been demonstrated theoretically using numerical simulation. Moreover, the performance of the controller has been demonstrated experimentally using a 1/10th scale model. For the 1/10th scale model, the requirements translate intotraverse an 80 kg payload 5 m in 6.8 s, including raising 1.5 m at the beginning and lowering 1.5 m at the end of motion, while reducing the sway to 5 mm in under 1.6 s. The experiments validated the controller. ","description-provenance":["ETDs_20110726_kdweeks ","unrestricted ","Made available in DSpace on 2011-08-06T14:45:25Z (GMT).

Pronounced differences in the chorionic sculpting of eggs of Eupeodes americanus (Wiedemann), Syrphus rectus Osten Sacken, and H. calcarata were documented. These differences can be used to separate these aphidophagous hover flies. Gross morphological descriptions of all life stages of H. calcarata were reported and the duration of the developmental period of all life stages was quantified. The phenology and relative abundance of H. calcarata was studied in the field using water pan traps, sticky traps, emergence traps, sentinel trees, and destructive sampling of aphid colonies. Sentinel trees with woolly apple aphid colonies were most effective for phenological studies, and showed that female H. calcarata were present in apple orchards from April through September. Emergence traps revealed that H. calcarata adults emerge from the duff or soil beneath apple trees.  Prey specialization of H. calcarata on woolly apple aphid was studied using no-choice and choice feeding bioassays and oviposition patterns in the field. Feeding studies compared the consumption of three, temporally sympatric aphid pests of applespirea aphid, Aphis spiraecola Patch, rosy apple aphid, Dysaphis plantaginea (Passerini), and woolly apple aphid. Compared with spirea aphid or rosy apple aphid, a pure diet of woolly apple aphid resulted in significantly higher larval survivorship and weight, and a significantly shorter developmental period. NaÃ¯ve, neonate larvae exhibited a marked preference for woolly apple aphid. Weekly counts of hatched and unhatched syrphid eggs revealed that H. calcarata was present only in woolly apple aphid colonies, where it was the most abundant hover fly species. Our data indicate that H. calcarata is a specialist predator of the woolly apple aphid in the apple ecosystem in Virginia.

This broad statement includes the rate of internalization in young versus mature apples as well as injured versus non-injured apples. Five apple varieties, Redfree, Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Rome Beauty and York Imperial, were used to compare differences and similarities in structure and ability to internalize the pathogen. Both the surrogate species, E. coli ATCC 25922, and the pathogen, E. coli O157:H7, were used for field and lab studies, respectively.   Internalization of E. coli in apples under natural environmental conditions was addressed in the first study using a controlled outdoor setting. Escherichia coli species (ATCC 25922) was used as an alternative to the pathogenic species. The bacterial culture was applied to topsoil and spread evenly on a 6x6-foot area. Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, and Rome Beauty apples were placed randomly on the soil much like a drop or windfall apple. The position was noted as to whether the apple fell calyx up, down or on its side. Apples were examined for the presence of E. coli and sampled on days 1, 3, 8, and 10. Skin, flesh, inner, and outer core samples were plated on MacConkey agar supplemented with cycloheximide and MUG to ease in identification. Escherichia coli was found in the inner core and flesh samples of all apple varieties, indicating the potential for infiltration by the organism outside laboratory conditions.  The second study determined the rate of internalization in immature apples. Redfree was used in a long-term study in which individual apples were spray inoculated at the beginning of the growing season with E. coli ATCC 25922 at 104 cfu/apple. The apples were picked on days 1, 30 and 60, and sectioned into skin, flesh, inner and outer cores. The remaining four apples species were used in an intensive, two-week study.   In the long-term study, apples were inoculated two weeks prior to harvest and picked every other day until harvest. The surrogate E. coli was not found in the apples after day 1. Other coliforms, such as E. vulneris, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kl. ozaenae were present in each pick. The two-week study showed higher rates of internalization in Red and Golden Delicious than in Rome and York, with the E. coli present in all four sections of the apples. Red Delicious apples showed a trend of increasing counts of bacteria over the two-week period with initial counts ranging from less than one cfu/ml to final counts as high as 2.64±1.90 log cfu/ml. Again Klebsiella species and E. vulneris were found in the apples.   Microscopy was used for imaging of the apples tissues. Morphological differences were found in the skin, where lenticel presence or absence may affect internalization. Differences were also shown in the flesh where cell wall thickness was shown to vary depending on variety. Imaging thick sections of skin showed cuticle cracks and thickness, which also vary depending on the apple variety.  This study indicates that internalization occurs at a high degree in drop apples and to a limited extent in tree apples. However, with the low infective dose required for illness, it is necessary to instate strict regulations to ensure safety. The most effective treatment involves the inclusion of a five-log reduction of the target organism, E. coli O157:H7. This reduction can be obtained through one step or the combination of two or more steps.

Different types of tests are conducted in order to evaluate various aspects of each type of cushion; in terms of their response to narrow-band (single frequency) dynamics, broadband input of the type that is commonly used in the trucking industry for testing seats (ISO2), and a step input for assessing the damping characteristics of each cushion. The tests were conducted over a twelve-hour period -- in four-hour intervals -- measuring the changes that occur at the seat cushion over time and assessing how these changes can affect the metrics that are used for evaluating the cushions. The tests indicated a greater stiffening of the foam cushion over time, as compared with the air-inflated cushion that showed almost no change in stiffness when exposed to a static weight for twelve hours. Furthermore, pressure measurements at the seat showed higher-pressure concentrations for the foam cushion at the bony prominence of the seat profile -- namely, the ischial tuberosities -- as compared to the air-inflated cushion. A series of tests aimed at evaluating the damping properties of each cushion showed both cushions to have nearly identical damping properties. Other methods used for evaluating the dynamic properties of the two seat cushions included those recommended by studies in the past, as well as new techniques that were developed specifically for this study. The new techniques, named Seat Pressure Distribution (SPD%) and Area Pcrms (aPcrms) for the purpose of this study, are formulated such that they can best highlight the dynamic differences between different types of seat cushions, and their effect on driver comfort. The results show that the air-inflated seat cushion can provide significant improvements in pressure distribution between the seat cushion and the driver, therefore providing a more comfortable ride and causing less fatigue.

To do so, this thesis develops and estimates an econometric model to explain and predict the demand for help-wanted advertising placed in a newspaper. For the most part, economic theory and the literature suggest that basic economic and demographic factors explain the demand for help-wanted advertising. The literature and empirical studies confirm an inverse relationship exists between unemployment rates and help-wanted advertising. This thesis confirms these findings using firm specific data for a major metropolitan newspaper. Surprisingly few other studies explore whether the price for advertising is also an important determinant of demand. My model includes both unemployment data and average price of help-wanted ads and finds that price is an important determinant for the demand for help-wanted advertising. Closer scrutiny of these relationships should remove some of the uncertainty associated with what now appears to be a volatile demand.

Head movement causes deformation of hair cell bundles in these organs, which translate this mechanical stimulus into an electrical response sent to the nervous system.  This study consisted of two sections, both utilizing a Fortran-based finite element program to study hair cell bundle response. In the first part, the effects of variations in geometry and material properties on bundle mechanical response were studied. Six real cells from the red eared slider turtle utricle were modeled and their response to a gradually increased point load was analyzed. Bundle stiffness and tip link tension distributions were the primary data examined.  The cells fell into two groups based on stiffness. All cells exhibited an increase in stiffness as the applied load was increased, but cells in the stiffer group showed a greater increase. Tip link tensions in the compliant group were approximately 3 times as high as those in the stiffer group. Cells in the stiffer group were larger, with more cilia, and also had a higher stereocilia/kinocilium height ratio than the cells in the other group. The stereocilia/kinocilium height ratio was the most important geometric factor in influencing bundle stiffness. Modeling a bundle as just its middle row of stereocilia resulted in some decrease in stiffness, but more significantly, a stiffness that was virtually constant as applied load increased. Tip link tension distributions showed serial behavior in the core rows of stereocilia and parallel behavior in the outer rows; this trend intensified if the tip link elastic modulus was increased. It was demonstrated that full three-dimensional modeling of bundles is critical for obtaining complete and accurate results. In the second part of the study, tip link ion gates were modeled. Sufficient tension in a tip link caused that link's ion gate to open, increasing the length of the link and causing its tension to decrease or the link to go slack. The two parameters that were varied were tip link elastic modulus and tip link gating distance d (change in length of the link). Bundle stiffness drops of up to 25% were obtained, but only when tip links went slack after gate opening; tip link slackening was dependent on tip link gating distance. Higher tip link modulus resulted in higher stiffness drops. Variable tip link modulus and tip link pre-tensioning were modeled. Variable tip link modulus resulted in increased bundle stiffness, especially under high applied loads, and in some cases, resulted in greater bundle stiffness drops when ion gates opened. Tip link pre-tensioning had no noticeable effect on bundle response. No evidence against inclusion of pre-tensioning or variable tip link elastic modulus was found.

In the inner ear, the vestibular system is responsible for the sense of balance. The main organs of the vestibular system are the semicircular canals, the saccule, and the utricle. Within each of the vestibular organs, sensory receptors in the form of hair cells detect motion and send a message to the brain for interpretation. Hair cells found in different parts of the inner ear are structurally different and are mechanically specialized to perform different functions. In this study, the linear and torsional stiffnesses were measured for hair cells located in the red ear slider turtle utricle. The system used to measure the stiffnesses was composed of a glass whisker (attached to a pipette) used to produce a force on the tip of the bundle, an extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometer (EFPI) to measure the displacement of the pipette, and a photoelectronic motion transducer (PMT) to measure the displacement of the bundle. Using the measured values of whisker stiffness, whisker displacement, and bundle displacement, the stiffness of the bundle was calculated using statics. For each bundle tested, the location of the bundle was determined by measuring its position from a landmark in the utricle, the line of polarity reversal, characterized by a 180o change in direction of the hair bundles. Stiffness results showed that the linear stiffness of a bundle increased in the area surrounding the line of polarity reversal, otherwise referred to as the striolar region (average linear stiffness of 2.27 E-04 N/m). The average linear stiffness value of bundles found lateral to the striolar region was 6.30 E-05 N/m and in the region medial to the striolar region was 1.16 E-04 N/m. A wide range of linear stiffnesses were found in hair cells medial to the striolar region. There was no correlation found between the torsional stiffness of a bundle and its position and the height of a bundle and its linear or torsional stiffness. As the force applied to a hair bundle was increased, the measured linear stiffness of the bundle also increased.

In addition, this thesis also examines the impact that college education has on the economic development of these counties, with particular focus on the role of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The thesis is composed of two papers\"Education and Socioeconomic Wellbeing in Racially Diverse Rural Counties\", and \"Economic Growth in Racially Diverse Rural CountiesThe Contribution of Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\"  The first of the two papers provides a descriptive review of the racially diverse rural counties (RDRCs) which are located exclusively in the rural south and generally have very low levels of economic well-being. On a positive note, college education levels in RDRCs are found to have increased rapidly between 1990 and 2000. County-level, regression analysis suggests that these increases were in part due to the concentration of Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the region. Local investments in K__12 education are also found to be linked to county education levels.  The second paper uses county subdivision level regression analysis, and finds that proximity to HBCUs influences college education amongst Blacks in RDRCs positively. Further county subdivision-level regression analysis suggests that the rate of college education attainment in these counties amongst Blacks and the general population has a significant positive impact upon income growth in RDRCs.

The concept proposes mounting the fuselages at the tips of a low aspect ratio wing. The motivation for this configuration is to provide an increase in the number of passengers carried with no increase in span over conventional designs. An additional motivation is the change in the wake flow of the wing, due to the fuselages and vertical tails, which may reduce the effect of the trailing vortex on trailing aircraft. During this investigation, two models of different scales were used to measure the aerodynamic forces and moments of the inboard wing configuration. The tests were conducted in the Virginia Tech 6X6 ft. wind tunnel using a six-component strain gauge balance. The Reynolds number based on chord for the small model was 465,000 and for the large model was 1,225,000. For reference, tests were also conducted with a plain wing having the same span as the full configuration. The L/D values found for this non-optimized configuration were modest compared to those for conventional transports. The vertical tails were shown to act as winglets, reducing drag and increasing L/D. These results suggest areas for substantial improvement in aerodynamic performance of the configuration.

The trade-off involved in DPM techniques is between the reductions of energy consumption and latency incurred by the jobs to be executed by the system. Such trade-offs need to be decided at runtime making DPM an on-line problem. In this context, the contributions of this thesis are two-fold. Firstly, we formulate the DPM problem as a hybrid automaton control problem. We model a timed hybrid automaton to mathematically analyze various opportunities in optimizing energy in a given system model. Secondly, stochastic control is added to the automata model, whose control strategy is learnt dynamically using stochastic learning automata (SLA). Several linear and non-linear feedback algorithms are incorporated in the final Stochastic Learning Hybrid Automata (SLHA) model. Simulation-based experiments show the expediency of the feedback systems in stationary environments. Further experiments are conducted using real trace data to compare stochastic learning strategies to the outcomes of several former predictive algorithms. These reveal that SLHA attains better trade-offs than the other studied methods under certain trace data. Advanced characterization of trace sequences, which allows a better performance of SLHA, is a subject of further study.

A field based investigation in Mesquite, NV, was undertaken from May to July, 2003, for the purpose of evaluating the significance of horizontal strain during an aquifer test. The hydraulic heads in the aquifer were monitored within a meter of the municipal pumping well used for the aquifer test and also at a distance of approximately 1,470 meters from the pumping well. Aquifer deformation in the horizontal and vertical directions were measured using GPS for the first 22 days of pumping in 10 different locations at radial distances from the well varying from 100 meters to 2500 meters. From 22 to 60 days of the aquifer test, the number of GPS stations monitoring deformation was reduced to five.  Radial displacement was measured at all monitoring stations during the aquifer test, indicating that the aquifer is moving closer to the pumping well. The greatest magnitude displacement measured 140 m from the well was approximately 10 mm at the land surface. A zone of radial compression occurred between the pumping well and the first monitoring station 140 m away from the pumping well. Vertical displacement was measured in decreasing magnitude with increasing distance from the well. Because GPS is not as precise a tool in the vertical direction as it is in the horizontal, the vertical signal of displacement is not as accurate. Numerical simulations using the BIOT and IBS codes were performed to reproduce the aquifer test and land deformation. The model included six layers representing three hydrogeologic unitsa bottom aquifer (four layers) in which pumping occurred , a top aquifer (one layer) in which the monitoring well was screened, and a semi-confining bed (one layer) between the two aquifers that represented an equivalent thickness of interbeds and clays layers. The Biot code was used to simulate radial and vertical movements in an axisymmetrical simulation, while the IBS code was used to simulate only vertical displacement but also provided for the simulation of elastic and inelastic storage and compression.  The vertical distribution of radial displacement was simulated using the BIOT code. At the onset of pumping, the greatest radial displacement occurred in the bottom aquifer in which pumping occurred. At a distance of 2,000 m from the well, the radial displacement was uniform over all depths indicating that the differences in hydraulic diffusivity are not as important a factor at distance from the well. The change in porosity that occurred as a result of horizontal strain was greatest in the bottom aquifer. Using the strain calculated directly from the GPS measurements at the land surface, vertical strain comprised almost 99% of the volume strain at the land surface. However, when the strain was simulated over the entire aquifer system, the radial and hoop strain contributed more than vertical strain in the bottom aquifer at a radius of 100 m from the pumping well at the onset of pumping until the aquifer reached near equilibrium, at which time vertical strain again dominated.

New Growth Theory is summarized into five conceptsknowledge and human capital, technology, flexible production and innovation, and the institutional environment. The IALR program demonstrates this NGT framework. The IALR program seeks to promote growth by attracting exogenous demand for innovation and high tech. Endogenously, the program plans to create an institutional support environment and human capital infrastructure. The New Growth Theory supports the IALR in developing a knowledge based economy. However, the New Growth Theory has limitations in application for economic development. It assumes that the targeted economy has some physical and social infrastructure. The Dan River region lacks transportation infrastructure and a history of valuing higher education. The New Growth Theory assumes that using knowledge as a factor will insure against diminishing returns. However, growth from high tech is risky and uneven. The IALR program is an example of an under-educated region trying to transform its economy by using high tech. What may happen is an increased gap between the lower and higher income population, with skilled knowledge labor being recruited and the existing human capital not able to keep up with the new skill requirements. Finally, while the Dan River region has a need to work on quality of life aspects, such as living conditions, equity, the environment, health and civic infrastructure, New Growth Theory does not consider these aspects.

Analysis of DNA from 41 samples of desiccated Nostoc spp. of varied age and global distribution led to the amplification of 43 independent tRNALEU(UAA) group 1 intron sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the entire data set made it possible to define the form species Nostoc commune. The synthase (spsA) and phosphatase (sppA) genes required for the synthesis of sucrose were isolated from cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 and overexpressed in E. coli in two different vector constructions. Transformants had a marked increased capacity for desiccation tolerance. Sucrose synthesis was confirmed through thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis of cell extracts from transformants.  Long-term stability of DNA in desiccated Nostoc samples was demonstrated by the ability to amplify selected gene loci from samples stored dry for decades. Successful amplification in some samples was possible only after treatment with phenacylthiazolium bromide, a reagent that disrupts covalent cross-links; indicating that the DNA was modified by cross-links that occurred between reducing sugars and the primary amines on the DNA. Abundant superoxide dismutase was released following rehydration of desiccated field material N. commune CHEN after 13 years in the dry state. sodF mRNA was present in the dry material but was turned over within 15 min of rehydration. mRNA levels then rose and appeared to reach steady state levels after 3 hours and remained abundant after 24 hours of rehydration.

Air and water are the two internal materials investigated. Three foundation variations are consideredrigid, Winkler, and Pasternak. Mathematica 4.2 was employed to solve the nonlinear equilibrium and dynamic equations, incorporating boundary conditions by use of a shooting method. General assumptions are made that involve the geotextile material and supporting surface. The geosynthetic material is assumed to act like an inextensible membrane and bending resistance is neglected. Friction between the tube and rigid supporting surface is neglected. Added features of viscous damping and added mass of the water were applied to the rigid foundation study of the vibrations about the freestanding equilibrium configuration. Results from the equilibrium and dynamic analysis include circumferential tension, contact length, equilibrium and vibration shapes, tube settlement, and natural frequencies. Natural frequencies for the first four mode shapes were computed. Future models may incorporate the frequencies or combinations of the frequencies found here and develop dynamic loading simulations.

Conducting bioassessment with benthic macroinvertebrates is still evolving and continues to be refined. There are strongly divided opinions about study design, sampling methods, laboratory analyses, and data analysis. Two issues that are currently being debated about study design for bioassessment in streams were examined here1) what habitats within streams should be sampled; 2) and is it necessary to identify organisms to the species level? The influence of habitat sampling design and level of taxonomic identification on the interpretation of ecological conditions of ten small streams in western Virginia was examined. Cattle watering and grazing heavily affected five of these streams (impaired sites). The other five streams, with no recent cattle activity or other impact by man, were considered to be reference sites because they were minimally impaired and represented best attainable conditions. Inferential and non-inferential statistical analyses concluded that multiple habitat sampling design was more effective than a single habitat design (riffle only) at distinguishing impaired conditions, regardless of taxonomic level. It appeared that sampling design (riffle habitat versus multiple habitats) is more important than taxonomic identification level for distinguishing reference and impaired ecological conditions in this bioassessment study. All levels of taxonomic resolution, which were studied, showed that the macroinvertebrate assemblages at the reference and impaired sites were very different and the assemblages at the impaired sites were adversely affected by perturbation. This study supported the sampling of multiple habitats and identification to the family level as a design for best determining the ecological condition of streams in bioassessment.

It has been stated that 75% of deaths due to falls in the United States occur in the 13% of the population age 65 and over. The first objective of the study was to identify which fall-predictor variables acknowledged in the research literature are associated with increased fall frequency with the older population. Identifying specific predictor variables related to a high occurrence of falls in long-term care setting can assist in the redesign of tools and programs aimed to recognize fall risk, and prevent fall-related accidents and fatalities in the geriatric population. The second objective of the study was to identify which combination of predictor variables could better predict the frequency of falls.  A history of falls variable was the only predictive variable that differed significantly between groups of residents who had sustained subsequent falls and those who had not. Other variables including age, mental status, day number of stay, elimination, visual impairment, confinement, blood pressure drop, gait and balance, and medication were found to not be statistically significant between groups of fallers and non-fallers. In this setting, the current design of the tool had limited accuracy and exhibited an inability to effectively discriminate between resident populations at risk of falling and those not at risk of falling. Consequently, the current fall risk assessment tool is not adequate for assessing fall risk in this clinical setting.

With the increasing reliance on mobile devices like laptops and palmtops, a new type of DoS attack is possible that attacks the batteries of these devices, called \"sleep deprivation attacks\". The goal of sleep deprivation attacks is to rapidly drain the battery of the mobile devices, rendering the device inoperable long before the expected battery lifetime, thus denying the service the user expects from the mobile device. The purpose of this research is to investigate these types of attacks so that proper defense mechanisms can be put in place before the attacks become a more sophisticated and potent force. This research presents three different possible methods that can be adopted by an attacker to drain the battery of a device i.e. malignant attacks, benign attacks and network service request attacks. These attacks are implemented on a variety of mobile computing platforms like palmtops and a laptop and the corresponding results are presented. Finally, a mathematical model is presented that estimates the battery life of a device based on its power consumption in various power management states and expected usage. This model can also be used to predict the impact of a DoS attack on the battery life of the device under attack.

However, application of the AMS techniques to the Mount Barcroft pluton, located in the northern White Mountains, has yielded anomalous scalar and directional AMS data indicative of unprecedented heterogeneity on the meter-kilometer scale. The 165 Ma Mount Barcroft pluton is primarily of granodiorite composition and was intruded into the Barcroft Structural Break, a northeast striking, steeply dipping structure that juxtaposes Mesozoic metavolcanic rocks to the north against Proterozoic-Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks to the south.  Two oriented hand samples (A and B) were collected at each of 78 sites distributed on a 1 kilometer grid pattern across the 5 by 15 kilometer Mount Barcroft pluton and oriented cores were prepared from these hand samples for AMS analysis. Microstructure identification of single thin sections prepared for each sample site yielded primarily magmatic with minor solid-state structures. A highly heterogeneous distribution of scalar parameters (Km, P%, F%, L%, T) was documented both between sample sites and between the A and B cores at individual sites. The heterogeneity may be the result of complex mineral assemblages and the interaction between different magnetic mineral species ranging from single domain to pseudo-single domain to multidomain magnetite. More problematic are the directional parameters between A and B cores in orientation and fabric type (e.g. prolate and oblate susceptibility ellipsoids) occur which cannot be readily explained by a complex mineral assemblage. Different fabric types in A and B cores at individual sample sites could be the result of discrete, temporally unrelated, magma pulses of variable composition and viscosity. Heterogeneity of scalar and directional AMS parameters in the Mount Barcroft pluton, and its contrast with the homogeneous AMS signatures within similar age plutons to the south, may provide evidence for a previously unrecognized magma source beneath the northern White Mountains.

Efficient and reliable routing of data from the source to destination with minimal power consumption remains the crux of the research problem. Fading mechanisms inherent in wireless communications can impact the packet routing mechanisms in these types of networks. In this thesis, we develop a mathematical framework for evaluating several network diversity schemes that take advantage of the random nature of fading to provide/ enhance the network performance. The efficacy of these different network diversity mechanisms are examined in slow-fading, frequency non-selective Rice and Nakagami-m multipath fading channels. Performance metrics such as the end-to-end outage probability and the end-to-end average symbol error rate are studied in the analysis of these types of networks with the proposed network diversity schemes. Numerical results reveal that the proposed schemes can offer significant power efficiency improvement in a variety of operating scenarios of practical interest.

The converter is a phase-shifted full-bridge PWM converter that is designed to operate as a front stage of a power conversion system where the input is a variable low voltage high current source. The converter is designed to step-up the low voltage input to an acceptable level that can be inverted to a 120/240 VAC 60Hz voltage for residential power. A DSP based adaptive control model is developed, taking into account line variations introduced by the input source while providing very good load dynamics for the converter in both discontinuous and continuous conduction modes. The adaptive controller is implemented using two voltage sensors that read the input and the output voltages of the converter. The controller's bandwidth is comparable to current mode control, without the need for an expensive current sensor, yet providing the noise immunity seen in voltage mode controllers. The intended input source was a fuel cell but in its absence a DC supply is utilized instead. The system is simulated for both discontinuous and continuous conduction modes and implemented and demonstrated for the continuous conduction mode. The test results are shown to match the simulation results very closely. ","description-provenance":["ETDs_20110726_kdweeks ","unrestricted ","Made available in DSpace on 2011-08-06T14:45:44Z (GMT).

However, a maximum possible turbine inlet temperature exits in the form of the adiabatic combustion temperature of the fuel. In addition, thermal limits of turbine blade materials also places an upper bound on turbine inlet temperatures. Thus, the current strategy for improving gas turbine efficiency is inherently limited. Introduction of a new gas turbine, based on an alternative work cycle utilizing isothermal combustion (i.e. combustion within the turbine) affords significant opportunities for improving engine output and/or efficiency. However, implementation of such a scheme presents a number of technological challenges such as holding a flame in high-speed flow. The current research is aimed at determining whether such a combustion scheme is feasible using computational methods. The geometry, a simple 2-D cascade utilizes surface injection within the stator or rotor boundary layers (including the rotor pressure side recirculation zone (a natural flame holder). Computational methods utilized both steady and time accurate calculations with transitional flow as well as laminar and turbulent combustion and species transport. It has been determined that burning within a turbine is possible given a variety of injection schemes using \"typical\" foil geometries under \"typical\" operating conditions. Specifically, results indicate that combustion is self-igniting and, hence, self-sustaining given the high temperatures and pressures within a high pressure turbine passage. Deterioration of aerodynamic performance is not pronounced regardless of injection scheme. However, increased thermal loading in the form of higher adiabatic surface temperatures or heat transfer is significant given the injection and burning of the fuel within the boundary layer. This increase in thermal loading is, however, minimized when injection takes place in or near a recirculation zone. The effect of injection location on pattern factors indicates that suction side injection minimizes temperature variation downstream of the injection surface (for rotor injection only). In addition, the most uniform temperature profile (in the flow direction) is achieved by injection fuel and combustion nearest to the source of work extraction. Namely, injection at the rotor produces the most \"isothermal\" temperature distribution. Finally, a pseudo direct simulation of an isothermal machine is conducted by combining simulation data and assumed processes. The results indicate that isothermal combustion results in an increase in turbine specific work and efficiency over the equivalent Brayton cycle.

Receive diversity techniques like maximal ratio receive combining have been popular means of introducing multiple antennas into communication systems. Space-time block codes present a way of introducing transmit diversity into the communication system with similar complexity and performance as maximal ratio receive combining. In this thesis we study the performance of space-time block codes in Rayleigh fading channel. In particular, the quasi-static assumption on the fading channel is removed to study how the space-time block coded system behaves in fast fading. In this context, the complexity versus performance trade-off for a space-time block coded receiver is studied. As a means to improve the performance of space-time block coded systems concatenation by convolutional codes is introduced. The improvement in the diversity order by the introduction of convolutional codes into the space-time block coded system is discussed. A general analytic expression for the error performance of a space-time block coded system is derived. This expression is utilized to obtain general expressions for the error performance of convolutionally concatenated space-time block coded systems utilizing both hard and soft decision decoding. Simulation results are presented and are compared with the analytical results.

A novel technique for generating effective vectors for delay defects is the first issue that we have presented in the thesis. The test set achieves high path delay fault coverage to capture small-distributed delay defects and high transition fault coverage to capture gross delay defects. Furthermore, non-robust paths for ATPG are filtered (selected) carefully so that there is a minimum overlap with the already tested robust paths. A relationship between path delay fault model and transition fault model has been observed which helps us reduce the number of non-robust paths considered for test generation. To generate tests for robust and non-robust paths, a deterministic ATPG engine is developed. To deal with small delay faults, we have proposed a new transition fault model called As late As Possible Transition Fault (ALAPTF) Model. The model aims at detecting smaller delays, which will be missed by both the traditional transition fault model and the path delay model. The model makes sure that each transition is launched as late as possible at the fault site, accumulating the small delay defects along its way. Because some transition faults may require multiple paths to be launched, simple path-delay model will miss such faults. The algorithm proposed also detects robust and non-robust paths along with the transition faults and the execution time is linear to the circuit size. Results on ISCAS'85 and ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits shows that for all the cases, the new model is capable of detecting smaller gate delays and produces better results in case of process variations. Results also show that the filtered non-robust path set can be reduced to 40% smaller than the conventional path set without losing delay defect coverage.

Compared to the CT treatment, ST reduced the total mass loss of NO₃⁻ by 37 percent, NH₃ by 54 percent, PO₄³⁻ by 12 percent, TP by 65 percent and TSS by 64 percent. The NT treatment reduced the total mass of NO₃⁻ by 49 percent, NH₃ by 46 percent, PO₄³⁻ by 17 percent, TP by 73 percent and TSS by 77 percent. Field experiment results showed that, respectively, the ST and NT treatments yielded 77 and 82 percent less chlorpyrifos, an insecticide, mass loss in runoff compared to CT. With respect to flumetralin loss, a growth inhibitor, the NT treatment yielded 30 percent less and ST yielded 6.8 percent more flumetralin mass, compared to CT.  The percolated water results show that compared to the CT treatment, ST resulted in 33 percent less NH₃, 7.5 percent less TKN, and 39 percent less PO₄³⁻ total mass. The NT treatment yielded 41 percent less NH₃ and 20 percent less TKN total mass loss compared to the CT treatment. The NT treatment had the most NO₃⁻, PO₄³⁻, and TP mass loss below the root zone, however NT also had the most percolated water by 53 mm (838 L).

The systemic parameters are mass, stiffness, damping, yield strength and geometric stiffness. Each of these parameters was varied one at a time while the other values were kept constant. For each variation of parameters a set of single-record IDA curves was obtained. Five to six ground motions were used for this study to generate the single-record IDA curves. These ground motions were scaled prior to their application on the structure. The scaling factor was based on the spectral acceleration at the fundamental frequency of the structure at 5% of critical damping. The scale factor is affected if the system parameters are changed. An important issue for this study was whether to persist with scaling corresponding to the median value from the range of the values of the parameter or to update the scaling according to the system. Based on some tests using both methods, the median scaling approach was found to be more suitable. The IDA curves for variation of parameters were then investigated to identify any trends that may help in qualitatively predicting the response of a system relative to another system. The response was measured by the peak displacement and the maximum base shear of the system. A clear trend was identified when the damping or the yield strength was varied. However, no definite trend was observed when the material stiffness or the geometric stiffness of the system was varied.

How can one building spans the area between heaven and earth, the space described in the cosmology of our pharonic ancestors? Certainly, to design such a building is a unique challenge, and an unprecedented opportunity, on this most privileged of sites in the history of mankind, that a museum is to be constructed capable of linking the immemorial past with the distant future spanning both the horizons of the ancients and those as yet unseen. Through the investigation of phenomenology, geometry, simplicity, purity and light, listening to the voice of silence, emerging to the light from the darkness, and by understanding the strength of simplicity after passing through complexity, This thesis offers an endless stream of ideas that challenge the mind. The vision for the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) is to establish a place where people from different nations and cultures will be able to immerse themselves in the rich culture heritage from more than 5.000 years of Egyptian civilization. With the support of new technology, more effective and efficient dissemination of information can be achieved, enabling the New Museum to be a source of enjoyable, entertaining, educational and cultural experiences for all visitors.  This project aims at structuring a complex of exhibits and facilities, which will accommodate all Pharaonic periods, it will be the largest museum in the world, and will provide access to information and future knowledge. It results from the careful articulation of the problem and a subsequent ordering of constraints within the context of the competition proposal.

In Texas, they hold a similar position, but the water is viewed with a great amount of subconscious reverence. Its cooling properties make it more than a toy for \"Marco Polo.\" Even people who cannot or do not want to swim will exert great effort just to dip their hands or wade their bare feet in a cool swimming pool.  The act of cooling is relegated to concerns of comfort, survival, and mechanical possibilities. It plays such an important role in the daily life of a Texan, especially in the summer, yet we treat our swimming pools, air conditioners, and ceiling fans just as any other American. Should such a vital aspect of a Texan's daily life be realized so mundanely? So crucial a factor in our lives must be uplifted to some form more poetic than the noisy A/C unit under the kitchen window.  In the Hill Country of Central Texas lies the village of Willow City, 1-1/2 hours southwest of the capital, Austin. A sinuous road, known as the Willow City Loop, winds north from the forgettable village through an untouched, untamed, semi-arid wilderness. The area is a stretch of vast expanses of granite and limestone often exposed with little or no topsoil. For a brief period during the springtime, the road becomes a traffic-congested line of families hoping to see flourishes of the in-bloom state flower, the bluebonnet. At all other times, the road is completely deserted.  A field of alternating pink, orange, and rust-white stretches for miles with frequent interruptions of various shades of green from mesquite trees, live oaks, cedars, cacti, and lichens. The topography constantly changes. Boulder-sized shards of granite seem to just explode out of escarpments. In other places, horizontal bands of granite cantilever from the tops of hills, displaying the years and time of its formulation. Two hills in particular, the Twin Knobs, comprise a striking composition of great architectural quality.  The architecture of the kidney-bean pool and the air-conditioner is inappropriate and inadequate when considering the significance of water in Texas. What is the architecture for the adoration of water in Texas? Where does one immerse oneself in water as a retreat from the sun and an act of tribute to that water? Furthermore, what is the form this architecture? How does such an architecture meld into a dynamic and varied topography? How does geometry generate or dictate such a form? Where do the geometry and formal expressions end and the architecture begin? Or, are they one? What is the nature of a human in such a place?  This book presents a retreat whose architectural focal point is a pool nestled in an excavated basin between the Twin Knobs. It is shielded by a great cone that forces the heat of the sun to yield to the repose of the pool and its water.

It also looks at subsequent versions of the CAPM including a multi-variable CAPM with the inclusion of selected macro-variables as well as a non-stationary beta CAPM to estimate portfolio returns. A new model is proposed that combines the multi-variable component together with the non-stationary beta component to derive a new CAPM that is more effective at capturing current market conditions than the traditional CAPM with the fixed beta coefficient.  The multi-variable CAPM with non-stationary beta is applied, together with the select macro-variables, to estimate the returns of a portfolio of assets in the oil-sector of the economy. It looks at returns during the period of 1995-2001 when the economy exhibited a wide range of variation in market returns. This paper tests the hypothesis that adapting the traditional CAPM to include beta non-stationarity will better estimate portfolio returns in a fluid market environment.  The empirical results suggest that the new model is statistically significant at measuring portfolio returns. This model is estimated with an Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimations process and identifies three factors that are statistically significant. These include quarterly changes in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Unemployment Rate and the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

It also examines issues relating to highway-user revenues. A review of the literature failed to provide any \"standard\" model of highway spending and no previous studies of spending across all levels of government. Using data from the 50 states and the District of Columbia over the three-year period 1998-2000, regressions were run on the dollars spent on highways in each state from all levels of government. The independent variables included highway-user revenues (as defined by the Federal Highway Administration) in each state from all levels of government, lane-miles, daily vehicle-miles of traffic, land area, percent of land area classified as urban, population, gross state product, annual average wage, percent of traffic consisting of trucks, and average winter temperature. OLS estimates using the classical linear regression model were found to be unreliable, and attempts at using a growth rate model provided poor overall fit.

A range of cardiac outputs was induced by use of a pharmacological protocol (dopamine, 4 ug/kg/min, dobutamine, 4 ug/kg/min, and 10 ug/kg detomidine plus 20 ug/kg butorphanol, in sequence). Changes from baseline CO in response to each drug were evaluated, and data was analyzed to determine whether there were any interactions between drug treatment and measurement method. The mathematical relationship between CO as determined by M-mode echocardio-graphy (COecho) and as determined by thermodilution (COTD) was described and used to predict COTD from COecho. The 2 methods were compared with respect to bias and variability in order to determine the suitability of COecho as a substitute for COTD . Sources of the variability for each method were determined.  Determination of CO by either method in standing horses was prohibitively difficult due to patient movement. The pharmacologi-cal protocol was satisfactory for inducing a range of cardiac outputs for the purpose of method comparison; however, use of dopamine did not offer any additional benefit over the use of dobutamine and was generally less reliable for increasing CO. Inclusion of detomidine provided an additional change in CO but did not increase the overall range of CO over that produced by halothane and dobutamine. COecho and COTD were significantly related by the predictive equation COTD = (0.63 +/- 0.157) x COecho + (16.6 +/- 3.22). The relatively large standard errors associated with COecho measurements resulted in a broad 95% prediction interval such that COecho would have to change by more than 100% in order to be 95% confident that the determined value represents true hemodynamic change. COecho underestimated COTD by a mean of 10 +/- 6.3 l/min/450 kg. The large standard deviation of the bias resulted in broad limits of agreement (-22.3 to +2.3 l/min/450 kg). Measurement-to-measurement variability accounted for 28% of the total variation in COTD values and 64% of the total variation in COecho values.

Study Design - Prospective, experimental study Animal Population - Six, clinically normal adult dogs. Methods - Using endoscopic assistance a unilateral L7-S1 foraminotomy was performed. Computed tomography of the region was performed in the pre-operative, immediately post-operative and 12-week post-operative time periods. Parasagittal area measurements were obtained at the entry, middle and exit zones of the treatment and control foramen for each period. Objective and subjective data were compared among dogs, by time period and treatment status. Results - Endoscopic assisted foraminotomy resulted in a significant increase in the mean parasagittal foramen area (mPFA) of the entry and middle zones in the immediate post-operative period. The exit zone was not made significantly larger at any time period. The foramen remained significantly larger at the 12-week post-operative period in the middle zone only. However, some decrease in the surgically created foramen enlargement occurred at all three levels. The dogs tolerated the procedure well, but did have a mild, temporary delay of functional return post-operatively. Conclusions - Endoscopic assisted foraminotomy in the canine patient can be performed for certain regions of the foramen allowing enhanced visibility in the spinal canal during the procedure. The foramen can be surgically enlarged at the entry and middle zones using this technique. There is some reduction of the foraminal enlargement at 12-weeks post-operative. The clinical significance of this reduction is not evident from this study. Clinical Relevance - Endoscopic assisted foraminotomy could be used to improve intra-operative visualization in dogs with foraminal stenosis as a component of degenerative lumbosacral stenosis.

A stress analysis corresponding to the different types of load during service with environmental effects, a moisture diffusion model, and a lifetime prediction analysis combining the above models has been constructed. The model uses an elasticity solution for axial-symmetric loading in the case of pressurized pipe, and an approximate non-linear solution for transverse loading due to soil pressure in the case of buried pipe. The axial-symmetric stress analysis has been constructed taking into account the moisture content and the temperature of each ply of the laminate. The moisture diffusion model takes into account the geometry of the laminate, the different diffusivity coefficients in each ply, and also the geometric changes due to ply failure. The failure mode and material behavior of the pipe has been investigated and identified according to Owens Corning data. Thus, the code that has been developed allows one to predict the time to failure of Owens Corning industrial pipes under any time-dependent profile of environmental and loading conditions.

Using motivation for authenticity and importance/performance variables as predictors, visitor knowledge, perceptions of crowding and conflict, and overall satisfaction are assessed.

The food industry is interested in determining the applicability of using an electronic nose for odor analysis of retained printing solvent levels in packaging. Three electronic nose systems were optimized for this application and their performance assessed. These include the FOX 3000, the Cyranose 320, and the QMB6.   Response surface methodology was used to generate 2nd order models of sensor response as a function of system and experimental parameters for the three electronic nose systems. Forty-seven of 50 sensor models generated were found to be significant at an a-level of 0.05. Optimum settings, that allowed adequate signals to be obtained for the full range of examined retained solvents levels, were selected for the remaining work using these models.   Performance analyses of these systems, which use three leading sensor technologies, showed that the conducting polymer sensor technology demonstrated the most discriminatory power. All three technologies proved able to discriminate among different levels of retained solvents. Each complete electronic nose system was also able to discriminate between assorted packaging having either conforming or non-conforming levels of retained solvents. Each system correctly identified 100% of unknown samples. Sensor technology had a greater effect on performance than the number of sensors used. Based on discriminatory power and practical features, the FOX 3000 and the Cyranose 320 were superior. The results indicate that electronic nose instrumentation can be used as a complimentary discriminatory tool in quality control.

Nevertheless, only a few multipath routing algorithms have been proposed and their interaction with transport layer protocols has not been thoroughly addressed in the literature. In this work, we propose the multipath “Fresnel zone” routing (FZR) algorithm for wireless ad hoc networks. FZR constructs multiple parallel paths from source to destination based on the concept of “Fresnel zones” in a wireless network. The zone construction method assigns intermediate routers into different “Fresnel zones” according to their capacity and efficiency in forwarding traffic. The central idea in FZR is to disperse traffic to different zones according to network load and congestion conditions, thus achieving better throughput and avoiding congestion at intermediate routers. FZR differs from most existing multipath routing approaches in that both source and intermediate nodes use multiple forwarding paths. FZR also adopts a combination of proactive and on-demand (reactive) approaches to reduce control overhead and latency for packet delivery.  Simulation experiments have shown that FZR outperforms unipath distance vector routing, multipath distance vector (MDV) routing, and split multipath routing (SMR) algorithms in quasistatic wireless ad hoc networks. In our simulations, FZR achieves up to 100 percent higher average throughput using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and 50 percent higher average throughput using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). FZR can also provide better load balancing among different paths, improve network resource utilization, and enable fairer resource allocation among different data transmission sessions. Future work is needed to evaluate FZR in mobile scenarios. ","description-provenance":["ETDs_20110726_kdweeks ","unrestricted ","Made available in DSpace on 2011-08-06T14:47:18Z (GMT).

In this thesis, we propose two schemes to establish real-time channels for soft real-time applications whose timeliness properties are characterized using Jensen's Time Utility Functions (TUFs) that are non-increasing. The two algorithms are (1) Localized Decision for Utility accrual Channel Establishment (LocDUCE) and (2) Global Decision for Utility accrual Channel Establishment (GloDUCE). Since finding a feasible path optimizing multiple constraints is an NP-Complete problem, these schemes heuristically attempt to maximize the system-wide accrued utility. The channel establishment algorithms assume the existence of a utility-aware packet scheduling algorithm at the interfaces. The route selection is based on delay estimation performed at the source, destination, and all routers in the path, from source to destination.  We simulate the algorithms, measure and compare their performance with open shortest path first (OSPF). Our simulation experiments show that for most of the cases considered LocDUCE and GloDUCE perform better than OSPF. We also implement the schemes in a proof-of-concept style routing module and measure the performance of the schemes and compare them to OSPF. Our experiments on the implementation follow the same trend as the simulation study and show that LocDUCE and GloDUCE have a distinct advantage over OSPF and accrue higher system-wide utility. These schemes also react better to variation in the loading of the links. Among the two proposed approaches, we observe that GloDUCE performs better than LocDUCE under conditions of increased downstream link loads.

Together with microtubule associated proteins (MAPs), they form the latticework on which eukaryotic life exists. Simply put, microtubules are polymers of tubulin heterodimers, which are composed of the globular proteins alpha and beta tubulin. In vivo, these monomers associate with one another to form heterodimers, which then polymerize to form microtubules.  In mammals, microtubule polymerization is a temperature-dependent process with an optimum of 37°C (Detrich et al., 2000). If temperatures exceed this optimal temperature by even a few degrees, the microtubule will begin to dissemble due to denaturation of the tubulin subunit and permanent loss of both shape and function will occur. This thermal barrier seems to be consistent in most eukaryotic organisms. Two exceptions are the thermophilic red algae, Cyanidium caldarium and Cyanidioschyzon merolae. These thermophilic acidophiles have been discovered in volcanic vents around the globe from Yellow Stone Park to Italy and grow at optimal temperatures of around 55°C. These organisms have been primarily studied in the context of evolutionary biology because of their primitive characteristics. Very little is known about the molecular biology of these organisms, and certainly nothing is known about how the biochemistry of these organisms brings about the ability to survive the harsh conditions of their environment. Currently, my hypothesis concerning the thermostable tubulin expressed within these organisms is that there may be key amino acid differences in the tubulin's primary structure that confer enhanced thermostability. I am testing this hypothesis by sequencing the alpha and beta tubulin genes of Cyanidium caldarium and Cyanidioschyzon merolae, generating homology models of the tubulin dimers, and comparing these models to a known mesophilic tubulin heterodimer structure in order to identify potential structural differences.

Surface features smaller than an electromagnetic wavelength are known to create diffracted fields over a wide range of scattering angles. In this thesis, the significance of such effects at low grazing angles with the presence of an extended planar surface is considered. The magnetic field integral equation (MFIE) describing the currents on such surfaces is used to solve for the bistatic scattered fields. The integral equations are discretized using the moment method and solved using the Method of Ordered Multiple Interactions (MOMI) iterative procedure. This thesis will concentrate on normal incidence and low grazing angle (LGA) incidence, specifically an incident angle of 80 degrees. The surface used in the analysis is a one-dimensional, perfectly-conducting wedge-on-a-plane with a varying radius of curvature at the wedge tip and Gaussian tails that smoothly extend the wedge to the plane surface. This surface displays continuous first and second derivatives over the entire surface. The radius of curvature at the wedge tip is varied between 0.0125 wavelengths and 8 wavelengths. The form of the bistatic scattered fields will be investigated for three different wedge height to wedge width geometries. The surface scattering mechanisms and their respective location and form in the scattered field will be discussed. The dependence of the scattered field pattern on the radius of curvature at the wedge tip and the beam width of the incident field will be considered. The difficulties associated with using a numerical technique on extended surfaces where a significant source of diffracted energy is present will also be examined. This includes the issue of sampling a surface that contains areas of small radii of curvature and the issue of surface truncation when significant currents due to tip diffraction are produced well outside the illuminated area. Both TE (VV) and TM (HH) polarization will be considered.  This thesis also analyzes the scattered fields for a perfect electric conducting (PEC) ridge and well in the presence of an extended planar surface for an incident angle of 70 degrees. The dual-surface magnetic field integral equation (DMFIE) formulation for a one-dimensional extended surface will be used to solve for the unknown currents on the surface of the scatterer. The DMFIE formulation leads to a second kind integral equation that can be solved via the MOMI series with the proper choice of the parameters appearing in the DMFIE formulation. The bistatic scattered fields for several ridge and well geometries are examined for both TE and TM polarization.

Many injuries to school-aged children occur during unsupervised peer activities, but peer influences on risky behavior in preadolescence remain under-investigated. We examined peer context effects on reported risk-taking, identified predictors of peer influence, and compared peer influence in high- and low-social-functioning groups. Forty-one boys aged 8-10 years listened to scenarios in which they encountered opportunities for risk-taking (e.g., swimming unsupervised, playing with matches) with their best friends, with \"cool guys\" (desired peers), with disliked peers, and alone. They rated the likelihood that they would engage in risky behavior in each condition for each scenario. Children also completed measures of friendship satisfaction, peer orientation, and socially desirable responding. Parents completed the CBCL and an injury history form. Children reported more risk-taking with positive peers than alone, and less with negative peers than alone. Four variables (peer orientation, friendship satisfaction, social problems, mother unmarried) accounted for 77% of the observed variance in peer influence on risk-taking. Children in the high social competence group showed larger peer influence, and indicated a preference for risk-taking with best friends over cool guys. Results are discussed in terms of improving injury prevention efforts by reconceptualizing \"peer pressure\" as a developmentally adaptive aspect of child functioning.

Twenty-five to fifty percent of late stage AIDS patients are infected with M. avium. M. avium has been recovered from drinking water and strains from water share identical DNA fingerprints with isolates recovered from patients exposed to the water. Further, M. avium is resistant to chlorine, a disinfectant commonly used in municipal water supplies. Because of the slow growth of M. avium, measuring its susceptibility to disinfectants is laborious and reaction to a potential problem is delayed. Thus, there exists a need for a rapid test to measure the antimycobacterial disinfectant capability of chlorine containing water samples. The objective of this research was to develop a rapid and quantitative assay for the viability of mycobacteria using firefly luciferase as a reporter gene for disinfection survival studies.  Derivatives of M. avium strains MD1 and A5, Mycobacterium smegmatis strain VT307 and Mycobacterium bovis BCG strain Pasteur carrying the firefly luciferase gene (pLUC10) were constructed. In pLUC10-carrying strains of M. avium strain A5 and M. smegmatis strain VT307, a direct correlation was shown between the quantity of light produced and the number of cells recovered as colony forming units. In disinfection studies of both pLUC10-carrying derivatives of M. avium strain A5 and M. smegmatis strain VT307, survival, as measured in colony forming units, correlated with survival in relative light units. Luciferase measurements appear to offer a method for rapid enumeration of mycobactericidal disinfection capacity of chlorinated water.

The thesis involved two phases of effort that evaluated the photometric measurements required in the ISO standard in terms of subjective image quality judgments. In phase one, seven monitors were evaluated photometrically according to the ISO 9241-7 standard to determine whether they were Class I, II, or III. Additionally, glare filters were attached to monitors to see if they change the ISO classification of the monitor. The results of phase one indicated that positive polarity always yielded either Class I or Class II because the Large Source, Screen Image Luminance Ratio (LR BDS/FDS) and the Specular Reflection Luminance Ratio (LR BDS/BD) always passed. Conversely, negative polarity always produced Class II or Class III because the Small Source, Specular Reflection Luminance Ratio (LR BDS/BD) failed every time. Also, the AF 150 and HF 300 were the best filters for reducing glare on monitors. The BF 10 and AF 100 or AF 200 ,on the other hand, were the worst because they intensified screen reflections. In phase two, human image quality judgments were collected to determine if people rated Class I, II, or III monitor-filter combinations differently under different lighting and different screen polarity conditions. Specifically, phase two assessed the effects of seven monitor/add-on glare filter combinations, five ambient lighting conditions, and two screen polarities on subjective image quality ratings. Each participant provided subjective image quality judgments by viewing alphanumeric text on the CRT screens. Subjective scale values also were correlated with ISO classifications and two ISO metricsscreen image luminance ratio (Diffuse, 200 lux) and specular reflection image luminance ratio.  The ANOVA findings indicated that specular glare significantly degrades image quality ratings more than diffuse glare. The author contends that this finding is the result of an experimental context effect. In other words, the specular glare was so influential on subjective ratings of image quality that subjects paid little or no attention to reductions in contrast from the diffuse lighting conditions. The correlation analysis showed that the specular reflection luminance ratio and the negative polarity classifications did index subjective quality ratings. Finally, this thesis establishes a human factors basis to justify the measurement requirements in the ISO 9241-7 standard.

When no forward vehicles are present, ACC function is the same as conventional cruise control. However, with ACC, when a slower vehicle is detected, the ACC system will decelerate and follow at a selected time-based distance. While slowing to follow, the driver will experience a system-controlled deceleration of the ACC vehicle. An experiment was conducted to evaluate driver preferences for the distance at which the primary deceleration occurs and the level of deceleration that is obtained. Driver intervention was required in one trial and driver response behavior was measured. Ten men and ten women in two age groups evaluated the decelerations from a cruise speed of 70mph to a following speed of 55mph behind a confederate lead vehicle on the highway. Evaluations can be made using four scalesGood vs. Bad, Comfortable vs. Uncomfortable, Jerky vs. Smooth, and Early vs. Late. Decelerations of approximately 0.06g which occur approximately 200ft to 250ft behind the lead vehicle were most preferred. Prior to intervention, foot position ranged from a point directly below the brake pedal to 16.4in from the brake pedal. Foot motion began between 21.12s time-to-collision (TTC) and 3.97s TTC. Eighty percent of the participants paused to \"cover\" the brake before final motion to activate the brake. The older age group intervened (braked) later than the younger age group. Driver braking after intervention ranged from 0.16g to 0.32g. ","description-provenance":["ETDs_20110726_kdweeks ","unrestricted ","Made available in DSpace on 2011-08-06T14:47:39Z (GMT).

This document presents a detailed experimental heat transfer study of six scaled up louvered fin geometries that are typical of those found in modern louvered fin compact heat exchangers. Heat transfer measurements were performed over a range of Reynolds numbers and with two different boundary conditions. A fully heated boundary condition allowed the effects of the thermal field to be observed while an adiabatic boundary condition allowed the effects of the flow field to be observed. The results indicated that the complex thermal and flow field patterns that developed within the louvered fin geometries strongly affected the heat transfer of individual louvers. In the entrance region of the louvered array, the effects of the flow field were dominant while in the fully developed region of the louvered arrays, the effects of the thermal field were dominant. A companion two-dimensional CFD study indicated that the heat transfer trends of the louvers resulting from both the thermal and flow fields were well predicted. Based on heat transfer performance, it was determined that the theta = 27°, Fp/Lp = 1.52 geometry performed the best at Re = 230 and Re = 370, while the theta = 39°, Fp/Lp = 0.91 geometry performed best at Re = 1016.

In addition to high data rate applications, UWB technologies also offer an extremely low cost alternative for many low data rate systems. In this thesis, we describe the design of a CMOS pulse generator for impulse based UWB systems. The structure of our pulse generator is based on the topology of a single tap CMOS power amplifier. By increasing the number of taps on a CMOS power amplifier, it is possible to generate sub-nanosecond pulses with a desired shape. A power saving scheme that significantly reduces the power consumed at low data rates is also described. The versatility of our design lies in the ability to support dynamically varying output power levels and center frequencies. Our pulse generator design is extended to a rectified cosine generator, necessary for a multiband approach. The performance of our pulse generators is estimated through simulation with a target technology of TSMC 0.18 µm CMOS at a supply voltage of 1.8 V. The simulation results indicate that our pulse generator produces high fidelity Gaussian monocycle pulses with a pulse width of approximately 160 ps and a peak output power of more than 10 mW. We believe that our design of a CMOS pulse generator for UWB systems is a feasible option for many applications in which power and cost are most important.

To automate such a system, a high fidelity model of a tracked vehicle is essential in designing a controller for each tracked vehicle in the system, and a system model is required to simulate its response to input commands. This thesis presents the 2-D mathematical models of a tracked vehicle and a multi-unit tracked vehicle. All existing track-terrain interaction models are investigated and modified. By employing the modified track-terrain interaction model and applying Newton's second law of motion, the equations of motion of both single and multi-unit tracked vehicles can be derived. Computer programs for simulating the motions of these tracked vehicles on level ground have been implemented on a digital computer based on the derived system of differential equations. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta and Keun's methods are adopted to numerically integrate these differential equations. The simulation results clearly show that the programs can accurately predict the motion of a tracked vehicle maneuvered on horizontal plane, and closely predict the response of a multi-unit tracked vehicle operated on level ground its command inputs.

Early detection of deterioration in PCC (e.g., alkali-silica reaction, freeze/thaw damage, or chloride presence) can lead to significant reductions in maintenance costs. However, it is often too late to perform low-cost preventative maintenance by the time deterioration becomes evident. Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods are potentially among the most useful techniques developed for assessing constructed facilities. They are noninvasive and can be performed rapidly. Portland cement concrete can be nondestructively evaluated by electrically characterizing its complex dielectric constant. The real part of the dielectric constant depicts the velocity of electromagnetic waves in PCC. The imaginary part describes the conductivity of PCC and the attenuation of electromagnetic waves, and hence the losses within the PCC media. Dielectric properties of PCC have been investigated in a laboratory setting using a parallel plate capacitor operating in the frequency range of 0.1MHz to about 40MHz. This capacitor set-up consists of two horizontal-parallel plates with an adjustable separation for insertion of a dielectric specimen (PCC). While useful in research, this approach is not practical for field implementation In this research, a capacitance probe has been developed for field application. The probe consists of two planar conducting plates and is made of flexible materials for placement on exposed surfaces of the specimens to be tested. The calibration method of both capacitive systems has been extensively studied to minimize systematic errors in the measurement process. These two measurement systems will be discussed and compared to one another on the basis of sensitivity and measurement repeatability.

Low- and high-hostile participants (25 males per group, drawn from the undergraduate Psychology pool) were identified using the Cook-Medley Hostility Scale (CMHS). Physiological measures (SBP, DBP, HR) were recorded at baseline, as were results from a dichotic listening procedure. Participants were then administered the cold-pressor procedure, and physiological recordings were taken again. Dichotic listening procedures were then administered 3 consecutive times to monitor for shifts in cerebral laterality. After the final dichotic listening procedure, physiological measures were taken once again to determine recovery rates. Results did not support the a priori hypotheses. Specifically, low-hostile individuals were consistently higher on the physiological measures when compared to the high-hostiles. The predicted maintenance of increased physiological arousal was also not supported by the data. Neuropsychological measures also failed to differentiate between the groups, and failed to demonstrate the predicted shift in cerebral laterality.

As such the proposed PRSM model advances the stated goal of FCS practice to \"promote optimal well-being of families, individuals and communities.\" Specifically, a PRSM model within the context of FCS should • describe person-environment interaction • as well as aggregates thereof (family and community) and • identify diverse daily impacts on the quality of living, personal well-being, societal satisfaction and overall quality of life • by modeling a consistent system of multiple options, each with a clear solution Twenty-three existing models appearing in resource management texts between 1975 and 1996 were evaluated for the ability to adequately support these assumptions, using the Liebert and Spiegler framework for evaluation of theory. Though most models provided partial support, no existing models fully fit the adopted criteria. Traditional resource management concepts were therefore adapted and extended using interdisciplinary findings to model the Personal Resource Systems Management (PRSM) concept.

In the past two decades, urban housing in China has been under a drastic transformation. As a critical component of the economy, the housing sector has played a very active role in restructuring China's economic system. The housing reform has encountered significant resistance. This research focuses on the property rights issue, which is a major concern in housing reform. With a comparative approach, the study addresses the basic research question, what are the fundamental barriers in urban housing reform. The research also involves a comprehensive review of the concept of the property rights and related issues in Western countries to establish a theoretical framework for furthering China's housing reform in term of property rights. The research also involves an inspection of housing reform in selected post-socialist countries to explore alternative transformation policies. Further housing reform policy is also articulated.

The demand for accurate stream flow measurement has increased with the rising concern about nonpoint source (NPS) pollution. NPS pollution studies, such as TMDL development, often involve quantification of flow in small first and second order streams. This application of technology intended for use in larger streams presents special problems that must be addressed by the user.  The goal of this study was to conduct a comparative analysis of the current technologies used to measure flow in small streams with respect to accuracy and cost. The analyses involved field investigations, laboratory experiments, and a cost analysis. The specific study objectives were1) Compare the accuracy of various methods for estimating stream discharge in small first and second order streams, 2) Compare the accuracy of various methods for estimating stream discharge in a controlled laboratory environment, and 3) Evaluate the costs associated with installation, operation, and maintenance of each of the systems investigated.  Ten stream-gaging methods were evaluated for their field performance, laboratory performance, and costs. Analysis of the field investigation data indicated that the Marsh McBirney current meter and the One-orange method were the most accurate among the methods studied. The results of the laboratory experiments imply that the Starflow acoustic Doppler and Valeport BFM001 current meter performed best among the ten methods. The Starflow acoustic Doppler device also proved to be the most cost-effective method. Overall, the Marsh McBirney and Valeport BFM001 current meters exhibited the best performance for both field and laboratory situations among the methods evaluated.

The communication cables are run through the elevator shaft from one call button to another and finally to the controller on the roof. Installing this wired link is highly time consuming. In this thesis, we propose the design for a wireless call button network. Two important features of this wireless network design are low cost and low power consumption. Controller Area Network (CAN) is a widely used protocol for wired networks and has been proposed for use in next generation elevator control systems. A modified CAN for wireless (MCANW) protocol has been developed for the wireless call button network. The wireless link will be implemented via the use of data radios. A modified form of traditional Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation scheme for the radios is proposed. The proposed modulation scheme, like differential BPSK, can be detected non-coherently but it offers better performance than differential BPSK. Its implementation includes an innovative tracking algorithm to maintain synchronization at the receiver.

Although public water supplies are safeguarded by regulations, aesthetically unappealing taste-and-odor problems have led consumers to search for alternative water sources, such as bottled water or tap water processed by point-of-use filters. Consequently, taste-and-odor monitoring has become important to the drinking water industry. Because many utilities use chlorine to disinfect the water, chlorine odor often masks other more subtle odors that may eventually cause consumer complaints. As treated water travels from the water treatment plant to the consumer, chlorine residual diminishes and may reveal a water's naturally less-pleasing odors. Consequently, odor monitoring at the water treatment plant, where chlorine concentrations are at a peak, may not identify potential displeasing smells. Proper evaluation of these odor-causing substances requires that the chlorine odor first be eliminated before evaluating any remaining odors. Dechlorinating agents can remove chlorine, but some will produce other unwanted odors or even remove certain odorous compounds. This research describes the efficiency of several of these agents (ascorbic acid, hydrogen peroxide, oxalic acid, sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate) in dechlorinating chlorinated solutions of the earthy-smelling compound geosmin and musty-smelling MIB.  Interfering odors in reusable containers pose another problem in drinking water odor analysis. The most common odor-analysis methods (TON and FPA) involve the use of glass flasks, which often either develop chalky odors or have persistent lingering odors from previous evaluations. Furthermore the glass flasks break easily and are difficult to clean. This research also evaluates the suitability of four types of disposable plastic containers for odor analyses.

Through his profoundly simple answer of architecture's essential existence, Kahn suggested that our works could never reach this state of being (even reason being unable to reach to far), leaving us only the ability to aspire towards it- with works ever to it, never with works of it. In the despair of our Modern response we set to achieve an end worth of its recognition which simply fails to acknowledge that the question was one of why, not one of what.  His answer, and its suppressive conditions of existence, is no longer solely acceptable to a student's question. To my Master I say, reconception is necessary; the answer requires a more dynamic essence. As it is with the nature and dynamic flow of all 10,000 things- one can never exist, though one is always existing; one can never live , though one is always living, and in our cultural and social attempts to assimilate and accommodate our environment- our attempts will never be, only ever becoming.

An ecotoxicological evaluation was performed using physical (water chemistry and sediment depth analyses), toxicological (acute water column, chronic sediment and 35-day in situ toxicity tests) and ecological (benthic macroinvertebrate community sampling) parameters. Persistent acute toxicity (mean 48-hr LC50 of 30.3% to C. dubia) due to low pH (mean of 5.4) and high concentrations of dissolved metals (exAl ~ 10 mg/L) were responsible for the significantly depressed benthic macroinvertebrate community sampled in Thomas Fork. Heavy sedimentation (>30 inches), with no associated toxins, significantly decreased both abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates in Little Leading Creek. High concentrations of sodium (mean of 910 mg/L), TDS (mean of 3,470 mg/L), and periodic acute water column toxicity (mean C. dubia survival of 62% in 100% sample) were most likely responsible for the depressed benthic macroinvertebrate community observed in Parker Run. In ranking the severity of impacts, AMD was first followed by non-toxic sedimentation, and active coal mining ranked last.   A catastrophic coal slurry spill significantly impacted the benthic macroinvertebrate community in Parker Run in April 1997. Six sampling stations were established to monitor the recovery of the stream's benthic community and evaluate any impact the active coal mine effluent had on the recovery time of the community. The effluent, characterized by high concentrations of TDS (~4,200 mg/L), significantly hindered benthic macroinvertebrate community recovery in Parker Run. The benthic community at the initial spill site, which was above the active mine effluent, recovered to levels measured at an upstream reference within 4-9 months. Benthic communities impacted by both the slurry spill and the effluent still had not recovered 16 months after the spill. Concentrations of TDS measured in the stream were significantly correlated (r = -0.765 and -0.649 respectively) with both EPT richness and percent C. dubia survival in water column toxicity tests.   Laboratory analysis of synthetic coal mine effluent, similar in composition to that of the Parker Run effluent, was performed to determine toxicity thresholds for sodium, sulfate, TDS and conductivity. Acute toxicity thresholds were found for sodium (between 900 and 1,000 mg/L), TDS (4,200 and 6,400 mg/L), and conductivity (5,000 and 6,200 µmhos/cm). It was also determined that any toxic contribution of sulfate in solution with high concentrations of sodium (~1,000 mg/L) and/or TDS (~4,200 __ 6,400 mg/L) was secondary to that of the toxic effect of sodium or TDS in that solution.

This study examined the regulation of thyroid hormone supply during development in (1) domestic chicken embryos (Gallus domesticus) exposed to a specific dioxin-like PCB congener (PCB-126) and (2) herring gull (Larus argentatus) embryos and pre-fledglings from Great Lakes sites with different chemical pollutant exposures. Specifically, PCB effects on thyroid status were evaluated by measuring plasma thyroid hormone concentrations and brain type II 5'D activity (to determine if PCB exposure was associated with alteration in brain 5'D type II activity that could maintain local T3 supply to the brain). If PCB-126 and PCB mixtures altered thyroid function, we expected to see decreased plasma thyroid hormone concentrations and subsequent increases in 5'D-II activity. Chicken eggs were injected (into the air cell) before incubation with five dose levels (0.0512, 0.128, 0.32, 0.64, 0.8 ng/g) of PCB-126 (3,3, 4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl), or vehicle (sunflower oil); sampling was on day 20 of the 21-day incubation period. Studies on PCB-treated embryos included a preliminary study and a larger study encompassing a serious of smaller studies. Herring gull embryos (at pipping, on day 25 of the 26 day incubation), and 28-day pre-fledgling chicks were sampled (for two field seasons) at several Great Lakes sites with different contaminant exposures (with Kent Island being the reference site). In PCB-treated chicken embryos, there were no statistically significant decreases in plasma T4 or T3 concentrations and no significant increases in brain 5'D-II activity in either the preliminary or the larger study. We found no clear pattern of altered thyroid function in herring gulls from polluted Great Lakes' sites. Plasma TH concentrations were not significantly decreased and 5'D-II activity did not significantly increase in birds from more contaminated sites in comparison to birds from Kent Island or sites with less contamination. Although pipped embryos from Strachnan Island had a significant increase in 5'D-II activity when compared to Kent Island, there were no differences in plasma TH concentrations, and brain 5'D-II activity was not significantly increased in birds from sites with greater PCB loads than Strachnan Island. Plasma T4 and T3 concentrations were significantly decreased in prefledglings from West Sister Island and Detroit Edison in comparison to Kent Island, but there was no subsequent increase in brain 5'D-II activity. The present study is the first to evaluate the potential effects of PCBs, alone and in a mixed environmental exposure, on circulating THs and brain 5'D-II activity in developing birds. Although thyroid function was not altered by the specific PCB congener used in my study or by exposure to environmental pollutants, more complete evaluations are needed before determining whether PCBs alter thyroid function in birds.

This study has focused on two insecticides, dieldrin and heptachlor epoxide, members of the cyclodiene class of insecticides. The cyclodienes are environmentally persistent, and brain residues of these compounds are correlated with the occurrence of PD. Cyclodiene mode of action has been attributed to two mechanisms1) facilitation of neurotransmitter release (with specificity for release of dopamine) and 2) antagonism of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. In order to assess the relative contributions of these two mechanisms leading to toxicity, eletrophysiological studies were undertaken in murine striatal slices. Extracellular recordings of spontaneous nerve discharge were used to compare the effects of the cyclodienes and the prototypical GABA antagonist, picrotoxinin, upon striatal neurons. At low micromolar concentrations of cyclodiene, depression of firing, consistent with dopamine release and not GABA antagonism, was seen. Alternatively, application of the prototypical GABA antagonist, picrotoxinin, produced excitation in slices. Additionally, the inhibitory action of dieldrin was blocked by a dopamine receptor (D1) antagonist, fluphenazine, verifying that cyclodiene-released dopamine was responsible for the observed depression of striatal neurons. These results suggest that the ability of these cyclodienes to evoke neurotransmitter release may significantly contribute to the neurotoxicity of these cyclodienes in vivo. In light of this data, the neurotoxic potential of the cyclodiene insecticides must be reassessed, particularly within the scope of PD.

The role of Pit-1 in avian species is unknown. Three turkey (t) Pit-1 isoforms have been identified that arise from alternative transcription initiation and alternative splicing. Splicing of exon 1 to an alternative acceptor splice site in exon 2 results in a 28 amino acid insertion in tPit-1β* relative to tPit-1*. Both isoforms initiate transcription at exon 1. A tPit-1 transcript unique to the turkey has been identified and arises following transcription initiation upstream of the alternative acceptor splice site in exon 2. Western blot analysis of pituitary extracts has revealed two isoforms of 37 and 40 kDa. The ability of Pit-1 to transactivate the Prl, GH, and Pit-1 promoters was determined with cotransfection assays. The tPrl, tGH, tPit-1 and rat (r) Prl promoters were cloned upstream of the luciferase gene in a reporter construct. Turkey Pit-1 isoforms and rPit-1 were expressed under the control of the Avian Sarcoma Virus Long Terminal Repeat (ASVLTR) promoter. Cotransfection analyses in mouse L cells indicate that tPit-1* activates the tPrl, tGH, tPit-1 and rPrl promoters 4.6-, 3.8-, 1.7-, and 29.0-fold, respectively. Similar results were observed when cotransfection assays were performed in a turkey pituitary-derived cell line and in primary turkey pituitary cells. These results indicate that tPit-1 is not a strong activator of the tPrl, tGH, or tPit-1 genes, whereas Pit-1 does activate these genes in mammals. A point mutation at amino acid position 176 (ser ⟹ leu) in the POU-homeodomain results in a mutant tPit-1 that shows decreased activity on all promoters tested. Turkey Pit-1* (ser-176) activates the rPrl promoter 14-fold lower than the wild type tPit-1* (leu-176).

Study sites included clearcut, shelterwood, mature-riparian, and mature-upland habitats. My primary objective was to determine whether the abundance, species composition and demographic characteristics (density, survival, reproductive effort) of small mammals varied with respect to forest cover type. Secondarily, I was interested in identifying patterns of small mammal habitat selection and the factors that influence those patterns at micro- and macroscales.  Small mammals were captured from May 1997-January 1999 on 10 sites (2 clearcut, 4 shelterwood, 2 riparian, and 2 mature) using a combination of Sherman live-traps and pitfall traps. Small mammal abundance and demographic characteristics were examined across forest cover types using a combination of statistical analyses, including Chi-square tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests and repeated measures ANOVA. I surveyed microhabitat features at individual trap stations (n=1000) using variable sized plots and the point quarter method and used these data to determine macrohabitat characteristics for sites (n=10). I examined species-habitat relationships at micro- and macro-spatial scales using Kruskal-Wallis tests, Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests, simple linear regression, stepwise multiple regression and stepwise logistic regression. Fourteen species of small mammals were captured over 7 trapping occasions. Five species including white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), northern short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus), and woodland voles (Microtus pinetorum), accounted for approximately 95% of the total number of individuals captured. Overall relative abundance and species composition of small mammals differed significantly across forest cover types. Catch per unit effort was greatest in shelterwoods followed by riparian, clearcut and mature forest cover types. I found significant differences in the abundances of white-footed mice and eastern chipmunks across forest cover types but not in those of northern short-tailed shrews, meadow voles or woodland voles. Shelterwood stands provided the highest quality habitat for white-footed mice and eastern chipmunks while clearcut stands provided high quality habitat for northern short-tailed shrews. Assessments of habitat quality for other species were based on weak evidence or inconclusive.  Microhabitat preferences for the 5 small mammal species with > 100 captures were generally consistent with those previously reported in the literature. White-footed mice, eastern chipmunks and northern short-tailed shrews were associated with woody debris and brushy microsites, while meadow voles were associated with grassy vegetation and woodland voles with the presence of soft mast and woody stem densities. For each of these species, microhabitat was able to predict presence at individual trapping stations at a level better than expected by chance. For white-footed mice and woodland voles, however, habitat selection was found to be dependent upon macrohabitat, suggesting that habitat selection for these species is dynamic.  Macrohabitat features were related to the abundance of several small mammal species. In general, the habitat characteristics important to individual species at microscales tended to be important at macroscales as well.  The results of this study suggest that current even-aged forest management practices on Quantico Marine Corps Base are compatible with the maintenance of native populations of small mammals. Disturbances created by harvesting, at least temporarily, resulted in favorable microhabitat conditions for a variety of small mammal species. Species such as southern flying squirrels, however, were sensitive to disturbance, although it is likely that successional changes allow rapid recolonization of disturbed sites.

The selection of user interaction channel is mostly dictated by the characteristics of the problem domain. For S4W, we chose to build a graphical user interface as human interaction interface, which was connected to other components via a high speed Local Area Network (LAN). The other key form of user interaction in a PSE is the visual representations of the abstract data results of simulations, perceived as user interface for data. The Complex nature of data sets in the domain of wireless simulations calls for a customized set of visualization tools. To address the specific needs of visualizations for S4W, ad hoc visualization tools were developed and integrated into the graphical user interface. A comparison of the integrated PSE and an earlier collection of unintegrated tools and scripts is presented.

Means and standard deviation for their age and BMI were 57.0±14.7 years and 30.5±7.2, respectively. The baseline exercise test was administered immediately after the patients arose from bed, following an overnight PSG diagnostic evaluation. The exercise test was repeated within ~2 weeks of completion of an overnight CPAP evaluation trial. Patients reported experiencing improved sleep quality (50%) after the CPAP titration, based on comparison of morning questionnaire responses from the diagnostic PSG vs. CPAP titration. Statistical significance was not attained (p>0.05) upon analysis of the following parameters at 60% of the individuals maximum workload although there were changes in the mean values of the variables from the diagnostic PSG vs CPAP titration. The following changes were notedheart rate increased by 6%, systolic blood pressure decreased by 6%, and the rate pressure product decreased by 5.8%. Respiratory variables changed as followsVO2 decreased by 5.3% and VE decreased by 8.5%. The perceptual measure rate of perceived exertion (RPE) decreased by 17.5%. These preliminary findings demonstrate that self-reports of sleep quality in patients with diagnosed OSA improved after a single night of CPAP titration, even in a setting wherein the total time of CPAP sleep and reduction of apneas, hypopneas, and hypoxemic episodes are highly variable. Additionally, sleep structure revealed a marked increase in slow wave (53.2%) and REM (30.4%) sleep with CPAP titration in comparison to the diagnostic PSG. It was concluded that CPAP titration effectively improves sleep structure and patient ratings of sleep quality, but does not have significant effects on cardiorespiratory responses to submaximal endurance exercise.

To gain insight into the mechanisms of the low susceptibility of cetaceans, we investigated the in vitro effects (1) of mercuric chloride (HgCl₂) on the ultrastructure and cell death of Atlantic spotted dolphin renal cells (Sp1K cells), (2) of HgCl₂ on the cell proliferation and cell cycle status of Sp1K and Rhesus monkey renal cells (MK2), and (3) of sodium selenite (Na₂SeO₃) on cell proliferation and cell death of control and HgCl₂-treated Sp1K cells. HgCl₂ affected multiple organelles and nuclei in Sp1K cells, and induced apoptosis in a time-and dose-dependent manner. Both ultrastructural changes and induction of apoptosis were milder than seen in other cell types in previous publications. In addition, Sp1K cells were able to proliferate at 25 µM HgCl₂ while MK2 cells were killed at 15 µM HgCl₂. An increase in percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase in the cell cycle and a decrease in S, and G2/M phase cells were seen in Sp1K cells exposed to more than 10 uM HgCl₂ more than 72 hours. MK2 cells showed cell cycle changes only at 24 hours exposure, and may be due to a sensitive subgroup. These data suggested that Sp1K cells were less susceptible than other cell types in a cell-specific way, which was independent of selenium protection. Concurrent exposure to Na₂SeO₃ provided protection against the HgCl₂-induced decrease in cell proliferation of Sp1K. The protective effects were greater if Na₂SeO₃ and HgCl₂ were premixed, but disappeared if exposures did not overlap. Although pretreatments with Na₂SeO₃ alone did not provide protection, they increased the protection of selenium administered later. Furthermore, Na₂SeO₃ decreased HgCl₂-induced apoptosis. These data demonstrated the Na₂SeO₃ protection against HgCl₂ toxicity in Sp1K cells in terms of cell proliferation and apoptosis. This study is the first report that reveals the existence of mercury-selenium antagonism in cultured cetacean cells. The data supported the hypothesis that selenium protection against mercury toxicity is, at least partially, through competition of binding sites and formation of mercury-selenium complex.

The software architecture proposed in this thesis allows for the secure and efficient running of a team-based decision support system, specifically TEAMDEC. Based on the system's requirements and architecture, three types of possible attacks to the system are identified and a security solution is proposed that allows for user authentication, secure communication, and script access control. The implementation of these features will reduce security risk and allow effective use of the valuable system information data.

Forty-eight right-handed males were recruited for participation with half classified as low-hostile and the other half as high-hostile. Previous research has shown that high-hostile males, at rest, have greater right hemisphere arousal relative to low-hostile males. It was predicted that this heightened, at rest, arousal would lead to reduced capacity to perform right hemisphere lateralized proximal tasks simultaneously.  Two commonly used neuropsychological tests sensitive to left and right anterior cerebral systems are the Controlled Oral Word Association Test and the Ruff Figural Fluency Test (RFFT) respectively. Nonverbal fluency, verbal fluency, and perseverative errors were assessed using these measures. Cardiovascular measures of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were assessed using oscillometric technique with a digital blood pressure meter.  A dual-task methodology was used to evaluate these anterior and posterior cerebral systems simultaneously. Since cardiovascular regulation and nonverbal fluency are both right-frontal tasks, it was predicted that high hostile men would evidence increased interference on cardiovascular regulation concurrent with the nonverbal fluency task in comparison with low hostile men. It was also predicted that high-hostile males would display more perseverative errors than low- hostile males on the nonverbal fluency task as a function of regulatory interference.  The results supported a capacity-limited prediction in high-hostile males. High-hostile males evidenced significantly heightened systolic blood pressure responses during the nonverbal fluency task in comparison with low hostile males. Further, high-hostile males displayed more perseverative errors in nonverbal fluency than did the low-hostile males. No differences were found in the overall fluency scores (verbal or nonverbal). These results partially support the expectation that differences exist between high and low hostile males for right frontal functioning. Moreover, these differences manifest in multiple domains of associated right frontal functioning. These findings extend the evidence for the proposed anterior-posterior inhibition model of hostility.

Current live HEV virus vaccines are immunosuppressive and predispose turkeys to secondary bacterial infections. Data indicates that the capsid proteins (fiber, penton base, hexon) of HEV are capable of stimulating protective antibodies against an HEV challenge.   Using tobacco as a model, we sought to determine if a plant could be used to synthesize the HEV fiber protein and produce sufficient antigen to stimulate protective antibodies. To introduce the fiber gene into plants, the coding region of the HEV fiber gene was fused to either a constitutive plant promoter (35S) or a wound inducible promoter (hmg2) on plasmids adapted for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Approximately sixty transgenic plants of each construct were generated and determined to contain the HEV fiber gene based on amplification of specific HEV DNA sequences by the polymerase chain reaction. Plants were screened by Northern dot blot to identify lines expressing high levels of fiber mRNA. Expression of fiber protein was observed in selected lines of transgenic tobacco by Western blot analysis using turkey anti - HEV serum. The accumulation of fiber protein in leaves of tobacco transformants was quantified by Sandwich ELISA. Fiber protein from these plants has undergoing large - scale purification and concentration for a turkey immunization trials to determine if plant expressed fiber antigen is capable of inducing protective antibodies against HEV in turkeys.

Research shows that most people are unaware about the proliferation of products that they use in their daily lives that are made out of or are derived from wood, about the amount (and shortcomings) of paper recycling in America, and the degree of environmental \"friendliness\" that wood and non-wood substitutes inherently possess. Students surveyed on Virginia Tech's campus could not state the main purpose of the United States Forest Service, nor could they identify the primary reason rainforests in South America are disappearing. Survey results from undergraduate students enrolled in the Department of Wood Science and Forest Products showed that they have a much better understanding of the environment and use of wood in people's lives. Survey results from students enrolled in the wood curricula closely parallel those from employees in the wood products industry. An exhaustive literature review of current academic and popular journals is summarized, as are results from the Virginia Tech survey. The impact that public misperceptions have on the wood products industry and steps to remedy them are also examined. Research findings show that the forest products industry needs a coordinated and centralized public promotion campaign to inform the general public about wood's attributes and environmental advantages.

Generally, aggregates are created under the assumptions that intra-group preferences are homothetic and the consumer's utility function is weakly separable over some partition. These assumptions place severe restrictions on the model that can significantly impact parameter and elasticity estimates. An alternative to imposing weak separability is to employ the Generalized Composite Commodity Theorem, which requires the relative intra-group commodity prices to be independent of the group price index. This study compares the results of estimating a demand system for composite beef, pork, and poultry products under the assumptions of weak separability and the Generalized Composite Commodity Theorem. Another important issue related to aggregation is the specification of an appropriate group price index. Price indices consistent with linear homogeneous preferences (a subset of the homothetic class of preferences) and non-homothetic intra-group preferences are identified and it is shown that several of the commonly employed indices are biased in the absence of complete price data.

The second objective was to quantify glutathione-S-epoxytransferase (GST) and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl-transferase (UDPGT) activities in R and S dams form the experiment and to determine whether reproduction during continuous cohabitation and liver detoxification enzyme activities were correlated within line x diet groups. Effects of the toxic diet were detectable within the first litters produced. Reproduction was more seriously influenced by the toxic diet within the S line than within the R line when these measures were compared within four equal time phases. The effects of the toxic diet on reproduction were greatest early in the experiment; by the fourth time phase differences among line x diet groups, with the exception of litter weight, were not significant. Percentage differences in total reproduction were greater between S mice fed the non-toxic diet and S mice fed the toxic diet than those between the R mice fed the non-toxic and toxic diets. Averaged across diets, GST activities were higher in R mice, but UDPGT activities were not significant. Within R line mice, GST was correlated with three reproductive measures, but UDPGT activity was not correlated with reproduction within any line x diet group.

This information led to the development of strategies to increase the use of wood in infrastructure markets across the US. The highway, marine/inland waterway, railroad and utility systems composed the four markets representing the US infrastructure. A total of 2344 questionnaires were mailed nationwide. The perceptions of wood were further defined through personal interviews with 112 individuals in four geographically dispersed states.  The most important factors in material choice decisions were durability, maintenance and cost. Environmental impact, ease of design and innovativeness of material were less important in the material choice decision. Highway and marine/inland waterway respondents perceived wood to be among the lowest materials in overall performance. Railroad and utility respondents perceived wood to have significantly better overall performance than highway and marine/inland waterway respondents.  Respondents perceived wood's advantages to be its aesthetically pleasing appearance, low initial cost, ease in repair and ease in field modification. They perceived the disadvantages of wood to be high life-cycle costs, high maintenance requirements and low biological decay resistance. Several strategies are suggested to increase wood use in infrastructure, includinggreater market approach by the wood products industry, improved timber structure design details, and increased service life of wood through improved chemical preservative treatments.

The resulting increasing popularity of desiccant-enhanced air conditioning systems has sparked new interest in the search for a better, more efficient desiccant material. The ultimate goal of this research was to develop a material that, when applied to an existing air-to-air heat exchanger, would achieve the necessary heat and mass transfer in a single process, thus transforming a sensible heat exchanger into a total enthalpy exchanger.  This study focuses on the development and determination of appropriate polymeric desiccant materials for use in different heat and mass transfer applications. Various candidate materials were initially studied. It was decided that polyvinyl alcohol best met the pre-determined selection criteria. After the focus material was chosen, numerical models representing two heat and mass transfer applications were created. One-dimensional numerical models were developed for the performance studies of a rotary wheel total enthalpy exchanger. A two-dimensional numerical model was developed for the performance studies of a fixed plate total enthalpy exchanger as well. Material characterization tests were performed to collect material property information required by the numerical models.  Sensible, latent, and total efficiencies gathered from both the rotary wheel total enthalpy exchanger and the fixed plate total enthalpy exchanger models indicate potential uses for some candidate polyvinyl alcohol materials.

Sensor networks can provide real-time information based on detection and tracking. This information cannot be reliable if little is known about the sensor coverage of the network, which can be defined as the total sensing range of the network due to contributions from each sensor node. Knowledge about coverage can also be useful in determining if there is any gap in coverage in the region of interest as well as improving the algorithm that determines the placement of nodes. Although coverage estimation is this thesis's central concern, other factors such as energy-efficiency and network lifespan that affect the network performance are investigated. Energy-efficiency and network lifespan depend on the communication model used for obtaining coverage information from each sensor node. This thesis proposes the use of B-splines for describing coverage efficiently. The properties of B-splines also enable communication models such as directed diffusion and hierarchical clustering to provide better performance as compared to a centralized scheme. Results obtained from simulation experiments indicate that hierarchical clustering and directed diffusion can be used effectively for coverage measurement. The hierarchical clustering model, however, exhibited some drawbacks such as a dependency on the routing scheme and poor node-failure recovery.

In recent years, advancement has been made to better understand the problems and minimize the cut-and-try portion of the design process. However, there are still phenomena difficult to explain in many practical design situations. Often, the problems may be solved by luck but many puzzles remain unsolved. If not fully understood, these puzzles are very likely to come back to haunt the designers.  According to the conventional theory, there are two modes of noisethe Differential-Mode (DM) noise and the Common-Mode (CM) noise. Recently, a new noise-coupling mode called Non-Intrinsic Differential-Mode (NIDM) noise was uncovered accidentally in the process of explaining certain EMI filter action [1]. This phenomenon has never been thoroughly studied. The focus of the present thesis is to investigate the NIDM phenomenon and its implications to practical EMI filter design issues.  The generation mechanism and basic characteristics of this phenomenon will be briefly reviewed, which is crucial to the understanding of the remaining parts of the research. Two essential diagnostic tools are introduced. One is the DM/CM noise separator and the other is the zero-span mode operation of a spectrum analyzer.  The results of the investigation will be presented. The results will be presented using practical examples, which tie the phenomenon to filter design issues. In some examples, explanations are given to dispel the puzzles commonly encountered in the practice.  A filter design procedure is suggested for off-line power supplies. This procedure incorporates the NIDM phenomenon into an existing design procedure. Only first-order and second-order filter topologies are included in the discussion.

The tests would take place on the FTF-II flight test plate mounted underneath a NASA F-15 aircraft flying at altitudes ranging from 15,000 to 45,000 ft. at Mach numbers ranging from 0.70 to 0.99. These conditions lead to predicted shear levels ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 psf. The gage consisted of a floating element cantilevered beam configuration that was mounted into the surface of the test plate in a manner non-intrusive to the flow it was measuring. Strain gages mounted at the base of the beam measured the small strains that were generated from the shear forces of the flow. A non-nulling configuration was designed such that the deflection of the floating head due to the shear force from the flow was negligible. Due to the large vibration levels of up to 8 grms that the gage would experience during transonic flight, a vibration damping mechanism needed to be implemented. Viscous damping had been used in previous attempts to passively dampen the vibrations of skin friction gages in other applications, yet viscous damping proved to be an undesirable solution due to its leakage problems and maintenance issues.   Three methods of damping the gage without a fluid filled damper were tested. Each gage was built of aluminum in order to maintain constant material properties with the test plate. The first prototype used a small internal gap and damping properties of air to reduce the vibration levels. This damping method proved to be too weak. The second prototype utilized eddy current damping from permanent magnets to dampen the motion of the gage. This mechanism provided better damping then the first prototype, yet greater damping was desired. The third method utilized eddy current damping from an electromagnet to dampen the motion of the gage. The eddy current damper achieved a much larger reduction in the vibration characteristics of the gage than the previous designs. In addition, the gage was capable of operating at various levels of damping. A maximum peak amplitude reduction of 33 % was calculated, which was less than theoretical predictions.  The damping results from the electromagnetic gage provided an adequate level of damping for wind tunnel tests, yet increased levels of damping need to be pursued to improve the skin friction measurement capabilities of these gages in environments with extremely high levels of vibration. The damping provided by the electromagnet decreased the deflections of the head during 8 grms and 2 grms random noise vibrations bench tests. This allowed for a greater survivability of the gage. In addition, the reduction of the peak amplitude provided output with vibration induced noise levels ranging from 24 % to 5.9 % of the desired output of the gage.   The gage was tested in a supersonic wind tunnel at shear levels of tw=3.9 to 5.3 psf. The shear levels encountered during wind tunnel verification tests were slightly larger than the shear levels encountered on the F-15 flight test plate during the flight tests, but the wind tunnel shear levels were considered adequate for verification purposes. The experimentally determined shear level results compared well with theoretical calculations ","description-provenance":["ETDs_20110726_kdweeks ","unrestricted ","Made available in DSpace on 2011-08-06T14:49:35Z (GMT).

The N-cyclopropyl analog (CPTP) of MPTP is a mechanism based inactivator of MAO-B which presumably is processed by a single electron transfer (SET) pathway to generate a bioalkylating species. These results have prompted us to study how the cytochromes P450, the major liver drug metabolizing oxidases, interact with N-cyclopropyl analogs of MPTP. HPLC with diode array detection and LC-electrosprary ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) based methods have been developed for metabolite detection and characterization. From the UV spectral data and pseudomolecular ion species observed by LC-ESI/MS, we have identified N-oxide, C-hydroxylated, and pyridinium metabolites. For the trans-1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl) analog, cinnamaldehyde and p-hydroxycinnamaldehyde also were characterized.  Incubation of CPTP and its derivatives with cDNA expressed human hepatic cytochrome P450 has shown that CYP2D6 catalyzes the formation of cinnamaldehyde, the N-descyclopropyl, pyridinium and hydroxylated products. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of the N-descyclopropyl and pyridinium species and cinnamaldehyde but it does not mediate any hydroxylation reactions. Since both the a-carbon oxidation and N-descyclopropylation transformations are mediated by a single enzyme (either CYP2D6 or CYP3A4), we propose a common intermediate for both pathways, namely the cyclopropylaminyl radical cation generated by the SET pathway. This intermediate partitions between the a-carbon oxidation pathway leading to the dihydropyridinium and pyridinium species and the ring opening pathway leading to the N-descyclopropyl metabolite and aldehyde species. The phenyl substituent on the cyclopropyl ring stabilizes the ring opened distonic radical cation and favors the ring opening pathway and results in the formation of less of the pyridinium species. The proton and methyl substituents on the cyclopropyl ring favor the a-carbon oxidation pathway and increased amounts of the pyridinium species are formed.

A fuel distribution terminal in the Eastern United States was selected as the test site. A release of diesel and jet fuels from the terminal loading rack area contaminated the unconfined aquifer beneath the terminal and migrated off-site, impacting commercial and residential areas. In the analyses, groundwater flow and transport models were calibrated to site data. The calibrated models were applied to simulate four remedial options(1) natural attenuation, (2) groundwater extraction, (3) groundwater flushing, and (4) microbial fences. Results of the predictive simulations indicated that the groundwater flushing remedial option provided the greatest reduction of benzene and TEX mass from the NAPL source as well as the lowest concentrations of benzene and TEX in the aquifer. The calibrated numerical models were able to predict the effectiveness of various remedial options and provide a basis for comparison. The modeling in conjunction with other factors, such as cost, were utilized to facilitate the decision making process.

But it is not always possible to find a flight at the right time to fly them to their destination. In the case where service in any one time period is insufficient to meet air travel demanded, it may be expected that some unfilled demand passengers will either delay their flight or will advance it, thus adding to the effective demand of the adjoining time periods.The obvious alternate means of travel is a rental car. It takes a lot more time than flight, but it is readily available at any given time. This brings us to think of an airline system that will work in a similar fashion; A system that can be named an \"Air Taxi System.\"  This would mean a virtual highway in air space leading to a vast network. The network would be served by small aircraft flying from one city to another loading and unloading passengers. Such a large network having dynamic demand will have many issues to resolve before successfully launching a Small Aircraft Transportation System. One of the most important problems to solve is scheduling of aircraft for such a stochastic demand flow.  The objective of the research is to study a given set of airports with dynamic demand and known aircraft type. The major task will be to analyze the flow of passengers between each origin-destination pair and then schedule flights. The research will be to develop a schedule for a fixed set of airports with dynamic demand and known type of aircraft. The main objective is to maximize demand satisfaction.

Three stockpiled grass-legume mixtures were evaluated for winter grazing. In addition, stockpiled forages were ensiled and evaluated as livestock feed. Four accumulation dates and seven harvest dates were randomized to small plots of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) -red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) -red clover, and orchardgrass-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). The amount of grass and legume in the fescue-red clover mixture shifted from less than 30% grass and more than 60% legume in October to over 60% grass and less than 10% legume in April. All forage mixtures contained at least 15% CP from November to March. Fescue-red clover was higher in TNC and lower in NDF, ADF and cellulose in January and March than the orchardgrass-legume mixtures. Fescue-red clover was higher in yield than the orchardgrass-legume mixtures from November to February. Delaying stockpiling until September 1 or 15 increased (P <.05) legume content and decreased dead grass content in orchardgrass-clover and orchardgrass-alfalfa. Accumulating growth from September 15 increased percent CP in fescue-red clover and orchardgrass-clover, compared to August 15, and decreased percent NDF in all forage mixtures. Percent IVDMD increased in orchardgrass-clover when stockpiling was delayed until September 15. May yields decreased only in orchardgrass-alfalfa when stockpiling was delayed until September. Orchardgrass stockpiled on August 3 and September 3, and alfalfa stockpiled on September 3 were ensiled alone. Chemical composition of silages was determined after 90 d of fermentation. Silages averaged 16.0% CP and 44.7% NDF. Digestibility of the ensiled stockpiled forages was estimated using acid insoluble ash as a marker with 18 wether lambs. No differences were observed in DM or CP digestibility, but NDF digestibility was lower for alfalfa silage than for orchardgrass silages. All stockpiled grass-legume mixtures provided high quality winter grazing, and all silages were of good quality and digestibility. Fescue-red clover maintained both good quality and higher yield than the other mixtures. Ensiling stockpiled alfalfa and orchard grass provided a method of maintaining CP and digestibility for subsequent feeding.

This approach enables the decision maker to determine the performance of its units of operations ('bus routes' in our case), optimally allocate scarce resources and achieve target levels for 'externality' variables for these bus routes and for the whole network.

To attenuate the large pressure oscillations in the combustion chamber, the fuel is pulsed so that the heat release rate fluctuations damp the pressure oscillations in the combustor. This thesis focuses on the development and implementation of a high-bandwidth, proportional modulation system for liquid-fuel active combustion control.   The throttle valve modulation system, discussed in this thesis, uses a 500-um piezoelectric stack coupled with an off-the-shelf valve. After comparing three other types of actuators, the piezoelectric stack was selected because of its compact size, bandwidth capabilities, and relatively low cost. Using the acoustic resonance of the fuel line, the system is able to achieve 128% pressure modulation, relative to the mean pressure, and is capable of producing more than 75% flow modulation at 115 Hz. Additionally, at 760 Hz the system produces 40% pressure modulation and 21% flow modulation with flow rates between 0.4 and 10 gph. Control authority was demonstrated on a single-nozzle kerosene combustor which exhibits a well-pronounced instability at ~115 Hz. Using the modulation system, the fundamental peak of the combustion instability was reduced by 30 dB, and the broadband sound pressure levels inside the combustor were reduced by 12 dB. However, the most important conclusion from the combustion control experiments was not the system?s accomplishments, but rather its inability to control the combustor at high global equivalence ratios. Our work indicates that having the ability to modulate a large percentage of the primary fuel is not always sufficient for active combustion control.

Techniques such as neural networks and fuzzy systems have found their way into transportation engineering. In recent years, neural networks are being used instead of regression techniques for travel demand forecasting purposes. The basic reason lies in the fact that neural networks are able to capture complex relationships and learn from examples and also able to adapt when new data become available. The primary goal of this thesis is to develop mode choice models using artificial neural networks and compare the results with traditional mode choice models like the multinomial logit model and linear regression method. The data used for this modeling is extracted from the American Travel Survey data. Data mining procedures like clustering are used to process the extracted data. The results of three models are compared based on residuals and error criteria. It is found that neural network approach produces the best results for the chosen set of explanatory variables. The possible reasons for such results are identified and explained to the extent possible. The three major objectives of this thesis are topresent an approach to handle the data from a survey database, address the mode choice problem using artificial neural networks, and compare the results of this approach with the results of traditional models vis-à-vis logit model and linear regression approach. The results of this research work should encourage more transportation researchers and professionals to consider artificial intelligence tools for solving transportation planning problems.

In contrast to expectancy-based behavior-change strategies, which offer a reward after a behavior is completed (post-behavior reward); reciprocity-based strategies present the reward first in the form of a gift (pre-behavior reward). Although there are no explicit contingencies attached to the gift, a sense of obligation to reciprocate may be a powerful motivator to comply with the request. It was hypothesized that pre-behavior rewards would be more effective than post-behavior rewards at low magnitudes of reward, and that both strategies would be effective at higher levels. This study examined effects of the timing and magnitude ($1 vs. $10) of a cash reward on compliance with a request to use a specially designed thank-you card recognizing prosocial and proenvironmental behavior. The hypotheses were not supported. The highest rate of compliance occurred in the post-behavior $10 condition, where 35.5% of participants complied, followed by post-behavior $1 (18.8%), pre-behavior $1 (12.9%) and pre-behavior $10 (8.8%). Pairwise comparisons revealed compliance in the $10 post-behavior condition was significantly higher than the rate of compliance in the $1 and $10 pre-behavior conditions, Chi-Square (1, n = 62) = 4.31, p < .05 and Chi-Square (1, n = 65) = 6.82, p < .01 respectively. The lack of evidence for the effectiveness of pre-behavior reward strategy is discussed and contrasted with previous findings.

The difference between these destinations and the traditional shopping mall is the experience gained when leaving the destination. As a solution, several cities have considered Urban Entertainment Destinations as a developmental means for revitalizing the downtown.  This thesis design project attempts to explore the significance of UED's by conducting a literature review and case study analysis of nine UED's across the United States. Studies extracted from each module revealed the importance of six key strategies- Placemaking, Multi-Anchoring, Contextual Links, Critical Mix & Mass, Programmability, and Branded Identity. Particular attention was placed on placemaking; designing gathering spaces, pathways, material choices, spatial relationships, and programmed land use. An emphasis has been made on incorporating the history and culture and the site's sense of place, two placemaking components that help create a distinct destination. These strategies were used as a basis for developing a set of design criteria that were in turn applied to the development of a master plan for a new UED in Rockford, Illinois.

The use of low value by-products such as poultry collagen, from poultry skins, and fat to improve flavor and quality in dry pet food could be economically attractive. This study examined a poultry collagen coating as a protective barrier against oxidation in dry cat food made with rendered poultry fat. Collagen was extracted from chicken skins, dissolved in an acidic solution, applied to dry cat food and dried to form a surface film. Six treatments were examinedkibble, kibble with fat, kibble with collagen, kibble with fat and collagen, kibble with fat, BHA/BHT and collagen and kibble with fat, tocopherol and collagen. There were two storage conditions‘jungle condition’ (42°C and 83% relative humidity) and ‘ambient condition’ (21°C and 51% relative humidity). In ‘jungle conditions’, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) was measured  over an eight-day period at day 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. In ‘ambient conditions’, TBARS was measured over a thirty-day period at day 0, 7, 14, 21, and 30. Water activity and moisture contents were measured. There were significantly higher TBARS (P<0.05) for the control kibble at both storage conditions. There was significantly higher fat percentage (P<0.05) in all treatments with the additional fat coatings. Fatty acid compositions showed slight changes during storage.

Much of the motivation for the development of μTAS stems from applications in biotechnology and biomedicine. A typical μTAS device includes a number of functional units ranging from sample injection or ingestion, pre-concentration, mixing with reagents, chemical reactions, separation, detection, and possibly a chemical response. Mixing of constituents is one of the key functions desired of these systems for conducting analyses in a short span of time. The flow regime in these small devices (typical sizes 100μm) being predominantly laminar (Reynolds number, Re < 1), it becomes difficult to rapidly mix the constituent species. Hence for effective mixing, it is necessary to increase the Reynolds number and/or induce bulk motion such that the material interface between the components to be mixed is continously augmented.  The method developed to induce such motion is by the application of an AC fluctuating potential field across a microchamber in which mixing is to be performed. The externally applied electric field applies a force on free ions in the charged Debye layer very close to the surface (1-10 nanometers) and induces a flow velocity which is proportional to the electric field. This applied fluctuating electric field gives rise to hydrodynamic instabilities which are responsible for increasing the material contact surface and hence augmenting the rate of mixing by an order of magnitude or more over pure diffusion.  To further enhance mixing, microbaffles are strategically placed inside the microchamber and the mixing time was further decreased by a factor of two. Mixing was also studied in a neutral (no charge on the walls) microchamber. It was found that the mixing achieved in the absence of surface charge was comparable to the mixing achieved in the case with microbaffles.  This work establishes that CFD is a useful tool that is capable of providing insight into the flow physics in devices with very small length scales.

Potentially deleterious interactions between the two fishes that may limit recruitment to age 1 were considered in terms of trophic relationships, physiological indices of health, overwinter survival, and post-stocking predation. Both fishes preferred habitat types characterized by structure-free sand or gravel substrates, but striped bass and hybrid striped bass did not exhibit significant diet overlap during the growing season. At a total length of approximately 120 mm, the juvenile moronids shifted from a mixed diet of zooplankton and invertebrates to a diet comprised primarily of age-0 fishes. However, after becoming piscivorous striped bass preyed primarily upon age-0 alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, while hybrid striped bass consumed age-0 sunfishes. Striped bass achieved mean total lengths of 229 and 173 mm by the end of the growing season in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Stocked into the reservoir three months later than striped bass, mean hybrid striped bass total lengths reached 133 mm at the end of the 2002 growing season. Condition factor, relative weight, and lipid index values were low, but nearly equivalent for both striped bass and hybrid striped bass throughout this study. Overwinter starvation of smaller (< 150 mm total length) striped bass was observed for the 2001-2002 sampling season. Predation upon stocked fingerlings was not considered significant in limiting juvenile survival; only three fingerling moronids were found in the examination of stomach contents of 200 potential predators captured near stocking sites. It does not appear that resource competition with hybrid striped bass during the growing season resulted in increased overwinter mortality of juvenile striped bass. Delayed stocking of hybrid striped bass lessens the potential for trophic competition between striped bass and hybrid striped bass at this early life-stage.

Current data suggest that at present time, 7.8 and 21.8 million women have osteoporosis and osteopenia respectively. The development of osteoporosis and related fracture in later life depends not only on the rate of bone loss in adulthood, but also on the amount of bone present at skeletal maturity. Oral contraceptives (OC), because of their capacity to diminish concentrations of free testosterone and estrogen, have been purported to affect bone mass in young adult women, but results have proven inconsistent. Further, positive skeletal effects of exercise training are thought to be compromised by use of OCs in skeletally immature females. PURPOSETo assess the independent and synergistic effects of OC use on bone mineral density (BMD) and long bone mechanical bending stiffness (EI) in college-aged females after unilateral isokinetic resistance training. METHODSForty six females (age 20 +/- 1.4 yr, height 163.8 +/- 6.2cm, weight 58.9 +/- 8.6kg, fat 27.9 +/- 4.8%) were categorized as OC users (OC, N=22) or non-users (NOC, N=24). Subjects participated in 32 weeks (3 d/wk) of unilateral arm and leg training at an angular velocity of 60 degrees/s using isokinetic dynamometers. BMD and EIMRTA were assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and mechanical response tissue analysis (MRTA), respectively. RESULTSTotal leg and arm muscular strength of the trained limb increased by 16% and 15%, respectively (p < 0.001), beyond changes observed in the control limbs. Total body BMD increased from baseline for NOC subjects (p < 0.05), but not for OC users. This difference failed to show significance (p = 0.069) when comparisons were run between NOC and OC groups. Increases in ulnar BMD (p < 0.01 for all limbs) and BMD of the trained total hip (OC, p < 0.001; NOC, p < 0.05) occurred irrespective of contraceptive status. Positive changes in EI were conflicting, occurring in the trained ulna for the NOC group (p < 0.05), and trained tibia for OC users (p < 0.05). Tibial BMD increased only for the untrained leg in NOC subjects (p < 0.01). No between group differences were found to be significant, nor were differences between trained vs. untrained, and weight bearing (tibia) vs. non-weight-bearing (ulna) limbs found to be significant. CONCLUSIONThese results suggest that oral contraceptives may limit attainment of total body peak bone mass in young adult females. Skeletal maturation in the ulna appeared to be unaffected by exercise training and OC use. Positive effects of exercise training on the total hip were seen in both groups, irrespective of OC status. Conversely, exercise training and use of OCs use may limit the attainment of bone mass in the tibia. Further studies are needed to determine the interactive effects of OC use and isokinetic resistance training on measures of total body and site-specific bone status.

By performing the study of domain dynamics and polarization switching over extremely broad time domains (10⁻⁸ t < 10² sec), more complete information has been obtained that allows for development of a better mechanistic understanding. Prior polarization kinetics studies have focused on relatively narrow time ranges, and were fit to the Avarami equation, which contains a single relaxation time. However, our broad band width polarization dynamics and frequency relaxation studies have been fit to multiple stretched exponential functions extending over decades of order of magnitude in the time domain. Stretched exponential functions for domain nuclei formation, and for domain variant growth have been found. For example, [001]c, [110]c, and [111]c oriented PZN-4.5%PT crystals, nucleation was found to be a volume process (n=3) rather than just a domain wall restricted process. Consequently, nucleation is heterogeneous. And, growth of a domain variant with reversed polarization was found to be a boundary process (n=2), involving diffuse or rough domain walls. We have extended these studies to various types of ferroelectrics including hard, soft and relaxor types.

The tPepT1 cDNA is 2,921-bp long and encodes a 79.4 kDa protein of 714 amino acids (AA) with 12 predicted transmembrane domains. The isoelectric point (pI) of tPepT1 is 5.9, which is much lower than that of PepT1 cloned from chicken (pI = 7.5) and other species. The AA sequence of tPepT1 is 94.3% identical to cPepT1 and ~ 60% identical to PepT1 from rat, sheep, rabbit, and human. Using a two-electrode voltage-clamp technique in Xenopus oocytes expressing tPepT1, Gly-Sar transport was pH dependent, but independent of Na+ and K+. For the dipeptides Gly-Sar and Met-Met, the evoked inward currents indicated that the transporter was saturable and had a high affinity for these substrates. However, transport of the tetrapeptide, Met-Gly-Met-Met, exhibited a possible substrate inhibition. To study developmental regulation of PepT1 in broiler and turkey embryos, 12 Nicholas turkey or Cobb x Cobb broiler embryos (six males and six females) were sampled daily from 5 d before hatch to the day of hatch (d 0). The abundance of PepT1 mRNA in the small intestine was quantified densitometrically from northern blots after hybridization with full-length cPepT1 and tPepT1 cDNA as probes. There was a quadratic increase (P < 0.001) in PepT1 mRNA abundance with age in turkey and broiler embryos. The relative increase in abundance of PepT1 mRNA in intestinal tissue from 5 d before hatch to d 0 was much less in the turkey than in the broiler (3.2-fold vs 14-fold). The dramatic increase in PepT1 mRNA abundance indicates a developmental regulation of the PepT1 gene and that there may be a crucial role for PepT1 in the neonatal chick and poult.

Traditionally, these analyses focus on developing estimates of abnormal returns attributed to the event or some measure of post-event loss in shareholder value. In 1989 Mark Mitchell used an event study to estimate the impact of the 1982 Tylenol poisonings on Johnson & Johnson's share returns. Mark Mitchell was able to demonstrate that (1) Johnson & Johnson share returns were significantly impacted by the poisonings, and (2) such an impact translated, at least in part, to a depreciation of brand name capital. This study sets forth the basic framework of Mark Mitchell's 1989 analysis and wherever appropriate, provides possible alternatives to his methodologies. Using several alternative approaches including, but not necessarily limited to, consideration of the incremental values associated with the Tylenol brand name, cost to develop the brand, alternative market factors, and changes in income streams I compare changes in brand value to brand name capital depreciation estimated by Mitchell. In some instances the aforementioned approaches are used in conjunction with aspects of Mitchell's methodology. The results tend to provide more accurate estimates of the loss in brand value possibly associated with the 1982 poisonings.

Samples taken from a shooting range near Blacksburg, VA, USA provide information about the reservoirs and pathways of lead at shooting ranges in an upland setting and humid environment. Metallic lead corrodes rapidly and develops a coating of corrosion products. The type and amount of corrosion products found on lead shot and bullets are best understood through examination of Eh-pH relationships. X-ray diffraction analysis identified hydrocerussite (Pb₃(CO₃)₂(OH)₂) as the corrosion phase present on lead shot recovered from the range. Hydrocerussite dissolution can produce soluble lead concentrations ranging from 2 ppb to 2 ppm for the soil pH values at this site. This soluble lead is captured by the soil. Sequential chemical extractions revealed that vertical lead migration beyond the A-horizon was minimal. The bound-to-Fe & Mn oxides and bound-to-carbonates soil fractions were identified as significant reservoirs for sequestration of lead in the soil. The highest concentration of extractable lead contained in the soil was directly correlated with the highest concentration of lead shot and bullets measured on the shotgun range surface. The geochemical framework for understanding the corrosion process, identifying the corrosion product(s) that control lead solubility, and identifying the geochemical barriers to lead migration that were employed at the Blacksburg, VA shotgun range, provides a basis for selecting best management practices for this and other shooting ranges.

Those that are economically feasible rely mostly on microbiological processes, which are only effective when the microorganisms remain in a healthy state. If a biological process upset was to occur, due to a toxic shock load or cold weather, it may result in a discharge of ammonia or total nitrogen into the receiving water body. The impact of such a discharge could have deleterious effects on aquatic life or human health. The main objective of the breakpoint pilot study was to define optimum breakpoint pilot plant operating conditions which could then be applied to the design of a full scale breakpoint facility and serve as an emergency backup to biological nitrification.  A pilot study was built on site at the Upper Occoquan Sewage Authority's Regional Water Reclamation Facility in Centreville Virginia. Testing was conducted in two phases (I and II) over a two year period in order to determine the operating conditions at which the breakpoint reaction performed best. Tests were performed during Phase I to determine the optimum operating pH, Cl₂:NH₃-N dose ratio, S0₂:Cl₂ dose ratio, and the minimum detention time for completion of the breakpoint reaction. Other testing done during Phase I included several special studies; including examination of appropriate analytical methods for monitoring breakpoint reactions, and investigation of the breakpoint reaction by-product nitrogen trichloride. Phase II testing examined how varying breakpoint operating temperatures, varying influent ammonia concentrations, higher influent organic nitrogen concentrations, and higher influent nitrite concentrations influenced the performance of the breakpoint pilot operation. Averages of data from operation at three different rapid mix pHs (7.0, 7.5, and 8.0) showed that pilot performance (i.e., ammonia oxidation) improved and the reaction was more stable at the higher operating pHs 7.5 and 8.0. Examination of dose ratios used during the study showed that the ideal operating ratios for this particular water was around 8:1 Cl₂:NH₃-N for the breakpoint reaction and 1.3:1 S0₂:Cl₂ for the dechlorination reaction. Although detention times for completion of the breakpoint reaction varied with pilot influent temperature, it generally required around 30-35 minutes to reach ammonia concentrations of < 0.2 mg/L NH₃-N at 8-12°C. Completion of the breakpoint reaction was found to be quickest at 20°C (the highest water temperature tested at the pilot). The tests of varying influent ammonia concentrations showed that although higher influent ammonia concentrations (11.0 mg/L) resulted in faster ammonia oxidation rates initially, the pilot operated better and had the same final performance results when the influent ammonia was lowered. Increasing the organic nitrogen concentrations (~ 1.0 mg/L) in the pilot influent resulted in a slightly higher Cl₂:NH₃-N dose ratio needed to reach breakpoint, a higher S0₂:Cl₂ dose needed to dechlorinate, and resulted in the formation of numerous disinfection byproducts. Increasing the nitrite concentration in the pilot influent increased the chlorination dose requirement.

Follicular aspiration was conducted once during wk 1 to 12 postpartum on 120 lactating cows with 6 groups, separated by biweekly intervals. Approximately one half of the aspirated cows at each session were from the early groups (wk 1-2, 3-4, or 5-6) and the other half from the later groups (wk 7-8, 9-10, or 11-12). On the day of aspiration the number of follicles on each ovary, and their sizes, small (2-5 mm), medium (6-10 mm) and large (≥ 11 mm), were recorded. The collected oocytes were morphologically classified into 4 grades, with 4 = excellent, 3 = good, 2 = fair, and 1 = poor. Blood samples from the jugular vein and follicular fluid samples from the largest follicle were collected in order to perform hormone and metabolite assays. Environmental data were obtained from the local airport. There was a significant (P < .01) quadratic days pre- and postpartum by parity interaction for BCS. Body condition score for older cattle was the lowest at 90 d prior to calving and changed the least amount over time, while youngest cattle had the highest initial BCS at d 90 prior to calving and had the greatest change in BCS over time. Body condition score was the highest during summer calving season (3.3 ± .06) compared to BCS during winter calving season (2.6 ± .06). But the loss in BCS was greater for cows that calved in summer (-0.53 ± .06) compared to cows that calved in winter (-0.07 ± .08). Increased serum NEFA concentrations with simultaneous decreases in serum insulin concentrations for younger cattle implied a more negative EB status than for older cattle. The total number of follicles and total number of oocytes retrieved was significantly (P < .001) affected by a linear days postpartum by parity interaction with younger cattle having linear increases compared to decreases in the total number of follicles for older cattle. Oocyte quality score was affected by the quadratic days postpartum by parity interaction (P < .01) and calving season (P < .01). Younger cattle had higher initial quality scores compared to older cattle, but older cattle had higher quality oocytes towards the end of the 12 wk period compared with younger cattle. Younger cattle had higher E2 and IGF-I concentrations in follicular fluid associated with a higher number of total follicles and number of oocytes, compared to older cattle. However, oocyte quality of younger cattle seemed to be reduced and oocytes were less competent than for older cattle. Cattle in 3rd and greater lactation showed very little change in BCS and hormone and metabolite measures during early lactation, with no apparent decrease in oocyte quality, despite the aging effect on follicle numbers. This study demonstrated that conditions related to early lactation have a negative effect on oocyte quality and endocrine measures of dairy cattle and that animals of different ages are differentially affected.

Since commercial forest acreage is predicted to remain fairly constant over the next 50 years, productivity must be increased if the South is going to meet a larger share of the nation'­s timber supply needs (Gjerstad and Barber, 1987). Hardwoods have been shown to have a consistent negative growth impact on pines, and uncontrolled hardwoods continue to compete aggressively with pines throughout a rotation, especially when hardwoods remain in the pine canopy.   Competing vegetation can be efficiently controlled by herbicides, which need to be formulated either in-can or in-tank to allow them to perform optimally. Adjuvants have proven essential to increasing the efficacy of herbicides, due to their ability to consistently improve the performance of the basic pesticide product. There are, broadly speaking, two routes by which adjuvants can do this. The first is the minimization of off target deposition and second, by the maximization of the herbicidal effect once it is placed on the target ( Reeves, 1989). The major contributors to off- target deposition and retention are drift, in-flight volatilization, droplet shatter, bounce or runoff, washoff, and removal by wind. These losses result in pesticides never reaching the target or achieving only transitory deposition. There are two basic methods of maximizing the effect of the pesticide once it is on the target. The first is to improve coverage by the spray solution, which can be accomplished by lowering the surface tension of the spray with surfactant materials. The second is by improving the penetration or uptake into the target. Organosilicone surfactants can reduce the surface tension of aqueous pesticides far below that which is possible with nonsilicone surfactants, resulting in efficient wetting of even the most hydrophobic leaf surfaces. Additionally, by virtue of their low surface tension, these adjuvants can significantly increase the uptake of active chemicals directly into the plant via stomatal infiltration ( Stevens et al., 1991).   Triclopyr ([(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyl)oxy]acetic acid) has been found to be an effective herbicide for hardwood control. Its two commercial formulations, a triethylamine (TEA) salt (Garlon 3A) and a butoxyethyl ester ( Garlon 4 ), vary considerably in their acceptability. The current ester formulation has two undesirable characteristics. One is that all ester formulations, regardless of chain length, have some volatility which is usually more than that of water-soluble salts. The second is that the current ester formulation utilizes a kerosene solvent which is known to cause rapid foliar necrosis (possibly inhibiting herbicide translocation) and is a suspected carcinogen ( Zedaker et al., 1995). In most applications, the ester formulation has been more efficacious than the amine formulation on both an equal active ingredient basis and on an equal cost basis. Research had demonstrated a potential to enhance the uptake of triclopyr through the use of organosilicones; however, significant problems still existed. It was found that the commercial TEA formulation of triclopyr (Garlon 3A) was &quot;antagonistic&quot; to the organosilicone surfactant Silwet L-77. To take full advantage of the properties of organosilicones, the antagonistic co-formulants of Garlon 3A needed to be removed or replaced, the best surfactant formulation identified, and a cost-effective concentration of the surfactant(s) needed to be found.   To do this adequately required that both physico-chemical processes and biological processes be studied. The relevant physico-chemical processes involved in a formulation's effect on spray impaction on the target plant include adhesion, reflection, retention and run-off. The important biological processes include the uptake and translocation of the herbicide into the plant.   The objectives of this study wereto evaluate the influence of formulation, active ingredient concentration, droplet size and leaf surface (adaxial vs. abaxial) on contact phytotoxicity, adhesion and retention to Acer rubrum, Liquidambar styraciflua and Quercus rubra by triclopyr formulations containing organosilicone surfactants and mixtures of silicone plus conventional surfactants. The adhesion and retention studies also evaluated the influence of leaf angle. Further objectives were to evaluate the influence of formulation and active ingredient concentration on spray retention by the adaxial and abaxial leaf surface of the selected species under field and track-sprayer conditions and to determine whether leaf characteristics (wax character and leaf angle ) could explain adhesion / retention.   Garlon 4, Garlon 3A and Triclopyr TEA + sequestrant (each at 0.32%, 1.6% and 3.2% ae) plus various concentrations of the surfactants Polyglycol 26-2, Rhodasurf DA-630, Surfadone LP-100, Silwet L-77 and Silwet 408, were tested for contact phytotoxicity, adhesion and retention on the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces of sweetgum, red oak and red maple.   Little or no contact phytotoxicity was observed with any formulation applied to the adaxial surface within 6 hours; some phytotoxicity was noted within 24 hours. Abaxial surface treatments showed much greater contact phytotoxicity. Contact phytotoxicity was caused by (1) increasing concentrations of stock triclopyr products, and (2) the influence of the organosilicone surfactants. However, these results were very species dependent. Conclusions made from the contact phytotoxicity study wereif the droplet size becomes too big, then efficacy will be reduced; increasing the concentration of active ingredient above a certain limit will not increase efficacy, and may in fact reduce it; the addition of the organosilicone surfactants Silwet L-77 and Silwet 408 delayed and reduced phytotoxicity in red oak ( the most susceptible species to contact phytotoxicity), and to a lesser extent in red maple, but increased the rate in sweetgum.   Major influences on adhesion weredroplet size ( increasing droplet size decreased adhesion); adaxial/abaxial leaf surface (abaxial adhesion less than adaxial); product concentration (increasing product concentration increased adhesion); leaf angle (increasing leaf angle decreased adhesion); and addition of surfactants (variable adhesion).   All new formulations gave greater adhesion than the commercial formulations, with Triclopyr TEA plus sequestrant plus n-octyl pyrrolidone plus Silwet 408 giving, overall, the greatest adhesion. Increasing product concentration gave greater adhesion. Increasing droplet size and angle of impact reduced adhesion. The adaxial leaf surface showed higher adhesion than the abaxial leaf surface. Adhesion was higher on sweetgum, followed by red oak, with red maple being the most difficult species to get formulations to adhere to.   Whereas increasing product concentration improves adhesion, the lowest contact phytotoxicity result would be from lowering product concentration. Looking at both sets of results, the best product concentration of those studied would then be 1.6% ae as this can provide high adhesion, while still enabling us to choose a formulation which gives minimal contact phytotoxicity.   In the laboratory, formulation had no significant effect on retention. However, there are other considerations which affect retention that need to be kept in mind. It was observed that droplets containing organosilicone could impact an already wetted surface and still adhere or be retained, whereas those droplets not containing any organosilicone surfactant would bounce quite a distance on impact with a pre-wetted surface. Impaction with an already wetted surface was not part of this study, and therefore was not studied quantitatively. Also, formulations containing organosilicone surfactants provide greater &quot;wrap-around&quot; to the lower surface ( Forster and Zabkiewicz, 1998), which is of great benefit when stomata are only on the abaxial surface, as is the case with these species.   Concentration and leaf angle also had no significant effect on retention. Droplet size was significant, with retention decreasing with increasing droplet size. Retention by the adaxial surface was significantly higher than retention by the abaxial surface. There was no significant difference overall between sweetgum and red oak, but retention by red maple was significantly lower.   Spray retention by the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces of the three tree species was also characterized in a field experiment conducted on a right of way site in North Anna, Virginia, USA. Amine ( Garlon 3A) formulations of triclopyr combined with Silwet 408, and the commercial triclopyr ester formulation, Garlon 4, were applied using a Radiarc sprayer equipped with 0.508 mm nozzles (approx. 1000 um droplets) applying 140 l/ha. The addition of the organosilicone surfactant Silwet 408 to the amine formulation gave the same total deposition as the commercial ester formulation, Garlon 4, while enhancing the abaxial retention as a percentage of total deposition. Thus the addition of organosilicone surfactant may have the ability to enhance herbicide uptake via the abaxial leaf surface, and therefore enhance efficacy. Field trial results showed that the alcohol ethoxylate, DA6, is not an essential component of the triclopyr amine / Silwet 408 formulation, in terms of retention.   The field trial application was also simulated on sweetgum, using a track-sprayer at the NZ Forest Research Institute Ltd. As in the field trial, the addition of Silwet 408 to triclopyr amine greatly enhanced abaxial retention as a percentage of total deposition, compared to that of Garlon 4. However, the track-sprayer results were very different from the field results, with amounts of adaxial and abaxial retention and total deposition much lower.   In agreement with published literature, it was found that the micro-roughness of the leaf surface can be used as a guide to explain adhesion results. The difference among trees in terms of leaf angles appeared to be much less important in explaining retention.

Microsatellite loci also were amplified for individuals collected from the following additional populations or species(1) E. capsaeformis from Duck River, TN; (2) E. florentina walkeri from Indian Creek, upper Clinch River, VA; (3) E. florentina walkeri from Big South Fork Cumberland River, TN; and (4) E. torulosa rangiana from Allegheny River, PA. Allelic diversity ranged from 9-20 alleles/locus, and averaged 13.6/locus for all 5 populations investigated. Average expected heterozygosity (HE) per locus ranged from 0.78-0.92, and averaged 0.86. A genetic characterization of extant populations of E. capsaeformis and E. florentina walkeri was conducted to assess taxonomic validity and to resolve conservation issues related to recovery planning. These mussel species exhibit pronounced phenotypic variation, and are difficult to characterize phylogenetically using DNA sequences. Monophyletic lineages, congruent with phenotypic variation among  species, were obtained only after extensive analysis of combined mitochondrial (1378 bp of 16S, cytochrome-b, ND1) and nuclear (515 bp of ITS-1) DNA sequences. In contrast, analysis of variation at 10 hyper variable DNA microsatellite loci showed moderate to highly divergent populations based on FST values, which ranged from 0.12-0.39. Quantitative genetic variation was observed in fish host specificity, with transformation success of glochidia of E. capsaeformis significantly greater (p<0.05) on the greenside darter Etheostoma blennioides, and that of E. f. walkeri significantly greater (p<0.05) on the fantail darter E. flabellare. Lengths of glochidia differed significantly (p<0.001) between species, with sizes ranging from 241-272 mm. Underwater photographs of mantle-pads and micro-lures of female mussels documented fixed phenotypic variation between species. The texture and color of the mantle-pad of E. capsaeformis is smooth and bluish-white, while that of E. f. walkeri is pustuled and brown, with tan mottling. Based on extensive molecular, morphological, and life history data, a population of E. capsaeformis from the Duck River, TN is described and proposed as a separate species, and a population of E. f. walkeri from the upper Clinch River, VA is described and proposed as a separate subspecies.  Genetic management guidelines were developed to assess taxonomic status, genetic variation of donor-recipient populations targeted for augmentation, and field and laboratory protocols to maximize genetically effective population size, minimize genetic changes in captive-reared progeny, and prevent the release of juvenile mussels into non-native drainages. A pragmatic approach to species recovery is advocated; one that incorporates the principles of conservation genetics into breeding programs, but prioritizes the immediate demographic needs of critically endangered mussel species.

Relative efficacy of sympathomimetic and parasympatholytic bronchodilators for relief of acute airway obstruction and improvement of pulmonary gas exchange was compared in 6 horses with COPD. Physical examination, arterial and venous blood gas analysis and measurement of end-tidal CO₂ tension were performed at time zero, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after administration of aerosol ipratropium (0.35 μg/kg), albuterol (1 μg/kg) or placebo via an equine Aeromask and metered dose inhaler. Physiologic shunt fraction (QS/QT), alveolar dead space fraction (VD/VT) and alveolar to arterial oxygen tension difference (p(A-a)O₂) were calculated using standard formulas. At time zero, horses demonstrated severe respiratory compromise and marked alterations in pulmonary gas exchange, indicative of alveolar hypoventilation, VA/Q mismatching and diffusion impairment. Ipratropium treatment significantly (p< 0.05) reduced arterial CO₂ tension and end-tidal CO₂ tension toward normal, but significantly increased p(A-a)O₂ from baseline. The change in paCO₂ after ipratropium treatment was significantly different from albuterol and placebo treatment groups. There were no significant changes in response variables after albuterol and there were no treatment by time interactions. These results indicate that, under the conditions of this study, ipratropium (0.35 μg/kg) improved alveolar ventilation and had superior bronchodilator efficacy than albuterol (1 μg/kg) in horses with severe COPD. Marked impairment of pulmonary gas exchange persisted after bronchodilators, emphasizing that anti-inflammatory therapy and environmental control are also necessary for effective treatment of severe equine COPD.

As a result, social structure and what were once traditional values have been abandoned for political correctness. With reports of personal crimes committed on juveniles on school property on the rise, clearly, these shifts away from tradition have trickled down from society at large to the sphere of the public school. Students no longer are using traditional socially accepted norms and values as viable guides to their behavior (Hudak, Ander & Allen, 1980), but violence, which has become a way of attaining respect and self worth as well as material possessions. Some of the most disturbing reports that have been brought to the public's attention are those of students assaulting and robbing one another at knife and gunpoint for clothing.  The conceptual framework was that of appearance perception. Clothing and appearance are extremely important to children in their efforts to compete as well as to successfully fit in with their peers. Many school reform efforts have implemented school uniform policies as a way of building a sense of unity and belonging among students, as well as a way of controlling behavior. However, despite the numerous studies that have attempted to show that nonverbal communication may form impressions of personality, character traits, and intelligence, none have focused on school uniforms and their reflection of the personal values of the wearers.  This study determined the uniform preferences of uniform-wearing students for middle school children, and described the five terminal values that these students attributed to uniformed students. This research also determined whether there were significant differences between the probabilities of males and females having the same perceptions of the terminal values attributed to uniformed students, because research has shown that these perceptions have a direct effect on style preferences.  The sample was comprised of 85 students between 18 and 21 years, who attended a military institute of higher education in which they were required to wear uniforms on a daily basis. Respondents completed a three-part questionnaire, which consisted of(1) Rokeach Value Survey, (2) demographics questions, and (3) wearer preference measure. The instrument was pilot tested for content validity before it was administered to the sample. Data were analyzed using Pearson Chi-squares and frequencies.  The chi-square tests revealed no significant differences in the probability of males and the probability of females selecting the same terminal values for uniformed students. Examination of frequencies determined design criteria for males and females uniform design as well as the five core terminal values attributed to uniformed students.

We examined the effects of CPAP therapy on physiological variables during a ramped exercise. The five male, OSA patients had mean values and standard deviations for RDI=60.7 +/- 19.1, BMI=29.9 +/- 2.9, and age=56 +/- 16.1 yr. Subjects were examined before and after 4 wk of CPAP therapy. After 4 wk of CPAP therapy, patient responses to exercise showed a 17.6%, (p<0.05) improvement in rating of perceived exertion (RPE) at identical power outputs (60% of the individual's apparent functional capacity). Statistical significance was not attained (p>0.05) upon analysis of the following parameters at 60% of the individuals maximum workload although there was a trend showing a decrease in these variablesheart rate (6% improvement), VO2 (11.7% improvement) systolic blood pressure (4% improvement), and rate pressure product (8.6% improvement). This data shows that the decrease in RPE during 60% of the individual's maximum predicted HR reserve corresponded with an increase in sleep quality (mean increase of 40%, 3.2 units) as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index before and after 4 wk of CPAP therapy. It was concluded that the improvement in exercise tolerance could be attributed to the subjective feelings of improved sleep quality after 4 wk of CPAP therapy.

The depletion of phosphates prior to cooking may be a major factor in this undesirable reaction. Thus, the effects on lipid oxidation with the use of an encapsulate to protect the phosphates during raw storage was investigated. Unencapsulated and encapsulated sodium tripolyphosphate (STP) and sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP), at a level of 0.5%, were compared to control samples in cooked, ground beef patties at 0 and 6 days. The unencapsulated and encapsulated treated samples were different (P<0.05) from the controls with an 81.1% to 89.7% improvement in the reduction of lipid oxidation. However, encapsulated phosphates did not decrease the level of oxidation beyond the unencapsulated treatment. This observation was attributable to the lack of a storage time prior to evaluating rancidity. Therefore, with an increase of precooked storage time, the 0.10% active encapsulated STP was essentially as effective as 0.20% unencapsulated STP for both 3 and 11 days.  Unencapsulated STP (0.3% or 0.5%), encapsulated STP (0.3% or 0.5% active), a blend of unencapsulated (0.3%) and encapsulated (0.2% active) STP, and a control treatment was incorporated in ground turkey breast and stored at 3Â°C for 0, 5, and 10 days. The treated samples were cooked to two different endpoint temperatures (74°C and 79°C) and stored at 3°C (4 and 24 hr) before cooking. An improvement of 77% and 80% was found in the reduction of Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) with the 0.3% and 0.5% encapsulated STP, respectively, in comparison to the unencapsulated STP. The best results were seen with a shorter storage time (4 hr) prior to cooking and a higher endpoint temperature (79°C). The unencapsulated and encapsulated STP were compared to commercial antioxidant blends, Lemo-fos and Freez-Gard FP 15, at a level of 0.5%, to determine differences in their capabilities of lipid oxidation reduction. The encapsulated phosphate was lower (P<0.05) in TBARS (3.5 mg/kg) in comparison to the treatments which ranged from 15.6 to 20.4 mg/kg. However, the CIE a* values were higher in the encapsulated samples due to the decrease in lipid oxidation. The effect of liquid nitrogen on TBARS values was investigated to identify a means of analyzing a large quantity of samples. The use of cryogenic freezing was not significantly different in TBARS in comparison with a fresh, unfrozen control. Raw and cooked ground turkey samples were submerged into liquid nitrogen and stored intact or immediately reduced in particle size to compare particle reduction effects on TBARS. The different particle reduction methods were not significantly different, although, the immediately reduced sample was more efficient in TBARS determination. The samples stored in an ultralow freezer (-80°C) for 14 and 33 days were not different (P>0.05).  Overall, when encapsulated STP is used with sufficient pre-cook storage time, lipid oxidation can be more effectively reduced than with the use of unencapsulated phosphates. The use of cryogenic freezing and ultralow temperature storage can also aid in the determination of lipid oxidation in large sample quantities due to the stability of TBARS values.

Currently, the EPA has set a chronic criterion of 0.035 mg/L (unionized ammonia). The chronic criterion is a four-day average concentration that cannot be exceeded more than once every three years. However, a lack of data exists on the toxicity of ammonia to saltwater organisms. Prior to this research, the chronic criterion was based on two saltwater and four freshwater organisms. This research was conducted to add additional data so more appropriate criteria may be set. Two saltwater fish, the Summer Flounder (Paralichthys dentatus), and the Atlantic Silverside (Menidia menidia) and one invertebrate, the Quahog Clam (Mercenaria mercenaria) were tested for acute toxicity to ammonia. The acute tests performed on the Summer Flounder (2 months old) were 48 and 96-hour tests performed in both synthetic seawater and natural seawater. Seven-day chronic tests were also performed on the Summer Flounder using synthetic seawater. Both 48 and 96-hour acute tests were performed on the Atlantic Silverside (10-14 days old.) using natural seawater. Both 48 and 96-hour acute tests were performed on the Quahog Clam (5mm shell height) using synthetic seawater. The 48-hour LC50s for the Summer Flounder in synthetic and natural seawater were 1.22 mg/L and 1.09 mg/L, respectively. The 96-hour LC50s for the Summer Flounder in synthetic and natural seawater were 1.07 mg/L and 0.889 mg/L, respectively. The 7-day chronic NOEC was 1.37 mg/L. The 48 and 96-hour LC50s for Atlantic Silverside in natural seawater were 1.52 mg/L and 1.18 mg/L, respectively. The 48 and 96-hour LC50s for Quahog Clam in synthetic seawater were 216 mg/L and 36.6 mg/L, respectively. The acute-chronic ratio for the Summer Flounder was 2.27. The refined chronic criterion was 0.081 mg/L based on this research and the research of others. Summer Flounder were more sensitive to ammonia in natural seawater than synthetic seawater. However, Atlantic Silverside showed no difference in sensitivity. ","description-provenance":["ETDs_20110726_kdweeks ","unrestricted ","Made available in DSpace on 2011-08-06T16:01:20Z (GMT).

In the present studies, preliminary data were generated showing limited but significant systemic immunotoxicity following low-level topical exposure to the pyrethroid insecticide, permethrin (formerly not considered an immunotoxicant). Permethrin was applied to the shaved dorsal interscapular region of C57Bl/6N mice at doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 5.0 μl/day. The highest of these doses was approximately equal to 215 μg/kg/day, which is about seven times the estimated daily human exposure in individuals wearing permethrin treated clothing for insect protection. Mice were thus exposed to permethrin daily for 10 or 30 consecutive days, or every other day for 7 or 14 exposures. Body weight was not affected by the treatment. However thymic weight was decreased and splenic weight increased 2 days after termination of the topical exposure. Histopathology of immune organs showed no significant changes. Splenic macrophages showed significantly depressed chemiluminescent responses up to 10 days following termination of exposure, but macrophage phagocytic activity was not affected. Cell surface markers of thymocytes, splenocytes and bone marrow cells were not affected. Antibody production as shown by plaque forming cell (PFC) assay decreased significantly at 10 days after dosing termination. Taken together, these data indicate that low-level topical permethrin exposure may produce systemic immunotoxicity.

Separate studies were conducted to evaluate the progression of osteoarthritis and to identify possible biological markers. First, 21 male, New Zealand White rabbits were divided into 3 groups (n = 7 / group). A randomly selected left or right stifle underwent a lateral meniscectomy. The 3 groups werecorticosteroid administration, forced exercise and surgical control. An open field maze was used to assess mobility weekly. The rabbits were euthanitized 47 days after surgery. Histopathologic examination found that the lateral meniscectomy induced more severe lesions than in the non-surgical contralateral stifle. It also showed a significant sparing effect on erosion of cartilage in the corticosteroid group. The corticosteroid group, but not the exercise group, caused a significant increase in mobility (p = 0.008) compared to the surgical control. Secondly, synovial fluid was harvested from the 12 rabbits on days 0, 6, 26, 40, and 57 with surgery occurring on day 12. Trypan blue was used in the lavage fluid to estimate the volume of harvested synovial fluid. There was a significant increase in the volume harvested on day 26 (p < 0.001). Superoxide dismutase concentration in synovial fluid increased after surgery, although not significantly.  These studies verify that the lateral meniscectomy model produce histopathologic lesions consistent with osteoarthritis. Furthermore, use of trypan blue appears to be a reliable concentration marker in a lavage sample to measure harvested synovial fluid.

Of the studies solely focusing on transfer student academic success, there is inconsistency in the variables selected for analysis and in the findings. Furthermore, transfer students from other four-year institutions are often excluded from these studies. The research generally focuses on transfers from a single community college (Townsend, McNerny, & Arnold, 1993) and oftentimes on transfers from a state's public community college system into the state's public university system (Graham & Hughes, 1994; Holton, 1991; Minear, 1998; Walker, 1992). There is a need for research that looks at transfer students from both two- and four-year institutions and that examines multiple variables associated with academic success.  The purpose of this study was to determine the value of the following factors in predicting the academic success of undergraduate transfer students in their first and second semesters of enrollment(a) on-campus residency, (b) ethnicity, (c) gender, (d) domicile (in v. out of state, (e) Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores, (f) number of credits enrolled in, (g) academic college, (h) class standing, and (i) last prior institution (two-year v. four-year). First semester GPA was included as an additional independent variable in the examination of second semester GPA.  The data analyzed in the study were collected in 2002 at a research institution in the mid-Atlantic region and were accessed through the student census file. Participants were students coded as entering undergraduate transfer students in the university's student census file during the fall of 2002. This study defined academic success as first and second semester Grade Point Average (GPA), which were used as dependent variables. The above factors were used as independent variables in a step-wise regression analysis. The results indicated nine significant predictors of first semester GPA. The following variables contributed positively to first semester GPA(a) SAT scores, (b) class standing, (c) being a student in the College of Architecture and Urban Studies, and (d) attending Community College (CC) #3. The following variables contributed negatively to first semester GPA(a) attending CC #1, (b) being Black, (c) attending CC #2, (d) attending Comprehensive University #1, and (e) attending CC #4. The only significant predictor of second semester GPA was first semester GPA. This suggests that the first semester predictor variables help set a student up for academic success or failure. That tracking then carries over generally to second semester. ","description-provenance":["ETDs_20110726_kdweeks ","unrestricted ","Made available in DSpace on 2011-08-06T16:01:22Z (GMT).

Panic frequency is routinely assessed either by simply asking individuals to estimate the number of panic attacks experienced during a given time in a questionnaire or assessment interview or by having them continuously self-monitor. Panic frequency obtained by such methods is unreliable and invalid or time-consuming, respectively. The purpose of this project was to investigate the reliability and validity of a Panic Attack Frequency Calendar (PAFC), modeled after a time-line follow-back (TLFB) procedure (e.g., Sobell & Sobell, 1979) that has been used for years to reliably and validly assess daily alcohol use through self-report over extended periods of time.  The participants consisted of 74 adult individuals (ages 18-57) who indicated that they had experienced a panic attack within the past two weeks. Participants completed a battery of self-report questionnaires, including a retrospective frequency measure, and administered an 8-week PAFC. Participants were then randomly divided into either a self-monitoring group that recorded information in a diary about any panic attacks that they experienced over the following two weeks or a non-self-monitoring control group. All participants were administered another retrospective frequency questionnaire and a 10-week PAFC two weeks after the administration of the first PAFC.  Reliability was determined from the two-week stability estimates across the PAFCs for the eight-week period that overlapped both assessments. This was done with several composite panic behavior variables; daily and weekly test-retest reliabilities were also calculated. Concurrent validity was established by comparing panic frequency from the PAFC with that obtained from the diary and the retrospective frequency measure. Further validity was established via correlating the PAFC with the self-report questionnaires. Results are discussed in light of their implications for the assessment of panic attacks.

George Eastman famously created the conventional photographic system, making the technology widely available to a mass market. Using the systems approach, I show how the Eastman Kodak Company consolidated critical photographic technologies through acquisition and research in the beginning of the twentieth century. Once the company achieved predominance in the industry, it set about expanding its markets. However, as the non-chemical elements of the technology advanced in the 1970s and beyond, the market changed. At the same time, foreign competitors matched and even surpassed Kodak's production efficiencies, threatening the company as never before. Just as Kodak began facing serious price competition in the 1980s for the first time in decades, electronics manufacturers introduced video camcorders and, later, digital still cameras. Dismissed by Kodak managers as inferior, the radical technology advanced far more rapidly than Kodak's chemical research. Computers in particular guided consumers to embrace new values, emphasizing a means of imaging that the conventional system could not match. Eastman Kodak's success with the older system created a protective mindset that led its managers to focus very narrowly on the survival of film. They viewed the new competitive landscape skeptically, and as a result they stifled innovation and prevented the company from aggressively competing in emerging technologies.

These management activities may have adverse effects on soil physical properties, site hydrology, and overall site productivity. Substantial quantities of wood residues are often left on these sites by timber harvesting operations, and it was hypothesized that the incorporation of this slash into the soil could improve the soil physical properties and site hydrology. One organic pocosin site and one mineral wet flat site were chosen post-harvest for treatment. The wet flat study was organized as an incomplete block design having four blocks and six treatments(i) conventional bedding, (ii) strip surface mulching with bedding, (iii) strip surface mulching with tillage and bedding, (iv) broadcast mulch without bedding, (v) broadcast mulch with bedding, and (vi) flat planted control. The pocosin study was organized as a randomized complete block design with four blocks and four treatments. The treatments are identical to those of the wet flat site without the broadcast mulch treatments (iv and v). Soil physical property data was analyzed pre- and post-treatment, while post-treatment site hydrology and soil water chemistry data was analyzed periodically for one year. Seedling survival and height data were analyzed after one growing season.  The treatments had little effect on soil physical properties, site hydrology, soil water nutrients, or seedling survival on the wet flat study site. Bedding in general significantly increased tree height growth, but mulching had no significant effects. The treatments had little effect on soil physical properties on the pocosin study site except for soil macroporosity, which was significantly increased by bedding. Site hydrology and soil water nutrients were not significantly affected by the treatments, but seedling survival and height growth were significantly increased by bedding. Mulching had no significant effects on any of the parameters studied. ","description-provenance":["ETDs_20110726_kdweeks ","unrestricted ","Made available in DSpace on 2011-08-06T16:01:23Z (GMT).

N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) reacts readily with exposed sulfhydryl groups, and has previously been shown to inhibit the activity of MT-motor proteins and tubulin assembly. This project seeks to investigate the mechanisms by which NEM affects motor function and inhibits MT minus end assembly. Recombinant motor domains of Drosophila kinesin (DK350 and DK375), Ncd (MC1), and squid kinesin (p181) were modified by NEM. NEM treatment was shown to affect the binding of MC1, but not recombinant kinesin proteins to MTs in the co-sedimentation assay. NEM treatment decreased the MT-stimulated ATPase rates of MC1 and DK350 in an NEM-concentration dependent manner, but did not affect the rate of DK375. Observed effects with DK375, p181, and MC1 were correlated with the number of labeled cysteines determined with [3H]NEM. As previously known, when NEM-treated tubulin was combined with untreated tubulin at certain ratios, assembly occurred only at the MT plus end. To investigate the mechanism by which NEM affects the polarity of tubulin assembly, tubulin was treated with NEM and assembly was analyzed using video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy. [3H]NEM was used to follow the time course of modification and to determine the number of modified sites per tubulin subunit. After 10 minutes, one cysteine was labeled on both a and b tubulin and this was sufficient to inhibit minus end assembly. Additionally, having one subunit labeled out of five tubulin subunits was sufficient to observe this effect. Protein digestion methods were used to aid in elimination of cysteines, to characterize potential critical cysteines in MC1, a, and b tubulin.

We also show that the multiplication rules for octonions can be derived from a special graph with seven vertices call the Fano Plane. Next we explain the Cayley-Dickson construction, which exhibits the octonions as the set of ordered pairs of quaternions. This approach parallels the realization of the complex numbers as ordered pairs of real numbers. The rest of the thesis is devoted to following a paper by N. Jacobson written in 1939 entitled \"Cayley Numbers and Normal Simple Lie Algebras of Type G\". We prove that the algebra of derivations on the octonions is a Lie algebra of type G_2. The proof proceeds by showing the set of derivations on the octonions is a Lie algebra, has dimension fourteen, and is semisimple. Next, we complexify the algebra of derivations on the octonions and show the complexification is simple. This suffices to show the complexification of the algebra of derivations is isomorphic to g_2 since g_2 is the only semisimple complex Lie algebra of dimension fourteen. Finally, we conclude the algebra of derivations on the octonions is a simple Lie algebra of type G_2.

In the first study, heifers were synchronized with CIDR inserts followed by TAI. Heifers in the estradiol cypionate (ECP) group were synchronized with a combination of ECP, CIDR, prostaglandin (PGF2α), and ECP (CIDR-ECP), while the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) group was synchronized using a combination of ECP, CIDR, PGF2α, and GnRH (CIDR-GnRH). All heifers were bred at either 48, 56, or 72 hours (h) after CIDR removal. Overall pregnancy rate (PR) for synchronized heifers was 60.1%, and embryo survival rate (ESR) was 98%. Pregnancy rate for CIDR-ECP treated heifers was influenced by artificial insemination (AI) time. In conclusion, ECP or GnRH may be used effectively in a CIDR-based TAI program in heifers. In the second study, cows were synchronized with CIDR devices or Ovsynch. The CIDR group received a combination of ECP, CIDR, PGF2α, and GnRH, while the Ovsynch group was synchronized using a combination of GnRH and PGF2α. Cows were bred at either 0, 8, or 24 h after the final GnRH injection. Overall PR for first service was 30.5% with ESR of 82.8%. Overall resynchronization PR was 35.1% with an ESR of 84.8%. In conclusion, Ovsynch and CIDR-based protocols are equally effective in synchronizing ovulation in a TAI program and resulted in comparable PR.

Release rates for iron, arsenic and sulfur are calculated for a variety of initial dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. Results indicate that the rate of arsenopyrite oxidation, represented by the rate law r = A(6.76 x 10-11) where the rate, r, is in mol/s and surface area, A, is in m2, is not significantly dependent on DO concentration. Arsenic and sulfur are released in a 1:1 molar ratio while iron is released more slowly due to precipitation of iron oxyhydroxides. Our results suggest that the rate determining step in arsenopyrite oxidation is determined by the attachment of oxygen at the anodic site in the mineral, and not the transfer of electrons from the cathodic site to oxygen, as is suggested for other sulfide minerals such as pyrite.  Previous work on FeAsS oxidation has been limited to low pH conditions with ferric iron as the oxidant. However, not all arsenopyrite weathering occurs exclusively in acidic environments. For example, at an abandoned arsenopyrite mine in Virginia, the pH of ground and surface waters is consistently between 4 and 7. Results of this study provide important insight to arsenic mobilization processes and rates, at field-relevant conditions, consequently aiding in the effort to understand arsenic release and retention in the environment.

However, poor motion cueing can greatly detract from the simulation and serve solely to distract the pilot. The latter was the case for Virginia Tech's three degree-of-freedom motion-base. The most common method of motion cueing is to use washout filters to produce the best motion cues within the physical limitations of the motion system. This algorithm is named the classical washout algorithm and its filters were studied first in this research, but initially yielded undesirable results. In efforts to greatly improve the acceleration response in the pitch axis, the concept of an acceleration feedback controller in conjunction with washout filters was investigated.  In developing a mathematical model of the motion-base and its corresponding circuitry, corrections and modifications were made to the circuitry which served to improve the dynamic response of the motion-base and enhance motion sensations. Next, design and implementation of the acceleration feedback controller for the pitch axis was performed and tested using a pilot rating scale and time history responses. The parameters for the acceleration feedback algorithm and the classical washout algorithm were varied to find the most favorable algorithm and set of parameters. Results of this paper have demonstrated the successful implementation of acceleration feedback and that the motion system at Virginia Tech now serves to greatly enhance the simulation environment.

Reasons for this include the public's affinity toward old and historic buildings, and the utter lack of undeveloped sites in urban areas. This thesis is directed toward creating a methodology in which to define the intervention and interaction between new to existing. The general attitude toward history and existing buildings is quite divisive. Typically architects demolish existing buildings or they attempt to preserve every detail and facet of a \"historical\" building. The National Historic Trust, apart of the Department of Interior, provides loose guidelines with which to guide an intervention or to otherwise treat a \"historic\" edifice.

In general, STB and HSB used similar habitats throughout this study. However, HSB used warmer (2-3'aC) water than STB during spring of 2001 and 2002. During the summer months, fish selected the coolest water temperature available that contained adequate (> 2.0 mg/L) dissolved oxygen. Striped bass habitat was more degraded than HSB habitat during summer stratification of both years.   Both moronids exhibited similar seasonal movement patterns. Upstream spawning migrations took place in March at 9-10'aC. Summer habitat was restricted to the lower 1/3 of Claytor Lake, whereas fish used the entire reservoir during other seasons. Minimum daily movement rates were similar between species and seasons (0.2-0.5 km/h). Hourly movement rates were also similar between species (0.2-0.3 km/h). One tagged fish from the reservoir was recovered below the dam, suggesting low rates of emigration.   Poor tag return rates by anglers limited confidence in estimation of exploitation rates. However, based on estimated natural and handling mortality rates and tag-reporting rates, estimated annual fishing mortality was 26% for STB and 14% for HSB, lower than rates found in VirginiaÂ¡Â¦s Lake Gaston and Smith Mountain Lake.

The purpose of this study was to explore the degree to which marriage and family therapists are seeing clients who have had Cybersex related difficulties. A questionnaire was mailed to 500 randomly selected clinical members of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. Thirty four percent of the sample responded. The results indicated that most of the respondents are seeing clients with Cybersex issues and the number of clients has been increasing over the past two years. The partners and children of Cybersex users were identified most often as the ones who came for therapy. Those who came with Cybersex as a secondary problem and individuals with Cybersex problems were identified less often. Although most respondents felt prepared to diagnose and treat adults with Cybersex problems, a half felt unprepared to diagnose and treat children. Most of the respondents reported that the required courses they took in College were not helpful in preparing them to diagnose and treat Cybersex related problems.

I chose light colored ash for my bed and cupboard, and I made them so they looked good on all sides, with the same wood and the same careful work back and front. I disregarded the usual practice of expanding less time and care on the back because no one ever sees it anyway. At long last I was able to round off the edges only slightly without being corrected, running the sandpaper swiftly and lightly over the edges to soften their sharpness without losing the elegance and fineness of the lines. I barely touched the corners where the three edges met. I fitted the door of the cupboard into the frame at the front with a maximum of precision so that it closed almost hermetically, with a gentle frictional resistance and a barely audible sound of escaping air.  It felt good working on this cupboard. Making the precisely fitting joints and exact shapes to form a whole, a complete object that corresponds to my inner vision, triggering in me a sense of intense concentration, and the finished piece of furniture added freshness to my environment.

Nonetheless, the US Department of Transportation has vigorously promoted (by issuing memorandums to be distributed to the Highway Agencies and State Departments of Transportation) the conversion of traditional contracts to performance based contracts to reach a goal of 80% of the service contracts and actions being performance based by the end of fiscal year 2004 (Tomanelli 2003.) Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) has been one of the first state agencies that took the initiative of using a performance based contract for the maintenance of a portion of its interstate highway system. This initiative resulted in the establishment of the 'Comprehensive Agreement for Interstate Highway Asset Management Services' between VDOT and a private contractor in 1996 which resulted in the privatization of highway maintenance services.  One of the important aspects of this contract related to this research is that it does not encompass any warranty clauses. In other words, the contractor does not provide any warranty to the VDOT for the services it is obligated to undertake. The contract is mute in this subject, making the contractor incur no liability for the underperformance of the maintenance activities. According to this research, this might lead to some cases which VDOT would not be willing to encounter.  Just like performance based contracting, the use of warranties in highway contracts in the United States is a quite new concept which mainly dates back to 1995. There are different views possessed by different parties about the possible outcomes of implementing warranties in highway contracts. Nonetheless, this research proposes that the incorporation of warranty clauses into the VDOT issued performance based road maintenance contracts is vital to ensure the quality and durability of the work after the project completion. According to this research, warranty clauses, if developed carefully, give the contractor the motivation to implement superior maintenance practices to improve the overall conditions of the assets during the contract period. This is done in order to lengthen the life of each asset item and achieve the long term performance. Ultimately, the incorporation of warranty clauses is believed to reduce the risk imposed upon VDOT. Within the context of the discussion presented above, this research first illustrates that the complete satisfaction of one of the parties (VDOT) may be in question due to the absence of the warranty clauses within the contract, then lists and explores the benefits that would/may be gained by the incorporation of warranty clauses into the contract, and finally develops a warranty clause template and proposes it to be used in the future performance based road maintenance contracts issued by VDOT. At the bottom line, this study aspires to help the party in question (VDOT) to reduce the risk imposed upon it and to improve the future performance based road maintenance contracts it will issue. This research uses the VDOT contract as a baseline to define the problem and to propose a solution (i.e. the developed warranty clause template) for that. Nonetheless, some of the principles and approaches used during the development of the warranty clause template can also be referred to for the development of warranty clauses for the performance based road maintenance contracts issued by the other state DOTs.

The increase in system voltage levels has caused the industry to face complexities not experienced with the lower-voltage systems. One such complexity arises from the larger system capacitance that results from the outby configuration commonly used on 4,160-V longwall power systems. Simulations show that during a line-to-ground fault, the larger system capacitance can cause a situation where the ground current sensed by the ground-fault relays in unfaulted circuits is greater than the mandated ground-fault relay pick-up setting. Simulations show that ground-fault relaying selectivity is potentially lost as a result of this situation. Two alternatives were identified which could improve ground-fault relaying selectivity. They arethe application of a directional relaying scheme and increasing the ground-fault relay pick-up setting. It was determined that directional relays have an application to high-voltage longwall power systems as the ground current sensed by the relay in the unfaulted circuits is out of phase with the ground-fault current sensed by the relay in the faulted circuit. Furthermore, it was determined that raising the ground-fault relay pick-up setting by a factor of eight would also improve ground-fault relaying selectivity. A safety analysis considering the potential for electrocution and the power dissipated by the maximum fault resistance showed that increasing the pick-up setting by a factor of eight would have no detriment to safety. Therefore, either method would improve ground-fault relaying selectivity on high-voltage longwall mining systems, yet because of the escalating size of longwall systems, a directional relaying scheme is a longer term solution.

Since its creation, the use and application of the Critical Path Method has grown tremendously. Up to date, three studies have been performed on how Engineering News Record's (ENR) Top 400 Contractor use CPM. The first study was performed by Edward Davis in 1974 and the second was performed by Amir Tavakoli and Roger Riachi in 1990. This paper is a summary of the third survey, which took place in 2003. The results from the three studies indicate that CPM use by the Top 400 Contractors is growing and the areas of use are expanding. The number one use of CPM throughout the years is detailed planning before the start of construction. Periodic control during construction is another large area of CPM use and has been a large area of growth due to the advances in technology, which make updating a schedule during construction easier and faster than was possible with a mainframe computer in the past. Another area of CPM growth is estimating and bidding for several reasonsuse in this area has jumped from 19% to 54% in the past 30 years. An area of concern lately in CPM is the use of precedence diagramming instead of arrow diagramming. Despite the debate, the responding companies found precedence diagrams easier to read, provide more flexibility, and allow for easier use of \"smart\" relationships (i.e. start-start).

In this thesis, we describe how digital library techniques can be employed to provide solutions to these problems and describe our experiences in creating a prototype for ETANA-DL. ETANA-DL is a model-based, componentized, extensible, archaeological Digital Library that manages complex information sources using the client-server paradigm of the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). We have designed and developed the prototype system with the following main goals1) to achieve information sharing between different heterogeneous archaeological systems, 2) to make primary archaeological data rapidly available to users, 3) to provide useful services to users of the DL, 4) to elicit requirements that users of the system will have beyond the services that it supports, and 5) to provide a sustainable solution to long-term preservation of valuable archaeological data. Consequently, we describe our approach to handling heterogeneous archaeological information from disparate sources; suggest an architecture for ETANA-DL, to be validated through prototyping; and show that given a pool of components that implement common DL services, a prototype DL can be rapidly created that supports several useful services over integrated data. Further, and most fundamentally, we note that understanding complex information systems is a difficult task. Finally, therefore, we describe our efforts to model complex archaeological information systems using the 5S framework, and show how we have used the resulting partial models to implement ETANA-DL with cross-collection searching and browsing capabilities.

The people-based strategies will relate to transportation policy, while place-based strategies will pertain to workforce policy.  The following research questions will be answeredWhat people-based policy changes need to occur through collaborative efforts to foster environments in urban areas that synthesize upward mobility through workforce development? What are the advantages of place-based and people-based strategies? How can transportation policy like Job Access and Reverse Commute grant programs, a people-based strategy, be changed to produce greater outcomes? What lessons can be learned from products of workforce development policy such as one-stop centers, a place-based strategy, in terms of performance? To answer these questions, the investigation uses case studies of Job Access and Reverse Commute grant and one-stop center programs, with the intent of deriving a framework for interagency coordination strategies. The case studies include the Northern Jersey Transportation, the Baltimore Metropolitan Regional Transportation and the Portland, Oregon Tri-Met Plans. In addition, one-stop centers within the same three regions were examined for potential connections. A comparative analysis of all the case studies will be performed focusing on six major components in order to propose a policy framework that includes federal influence, governance structure, mechanism to connecting with the marker, feedback mechanisms, incremental career step provisions, and accountability systems.

Specifically, I explored the organization and management; human, financial, and facility resource; campus and community relationship; program; mission; assessment and self-evaluation; and leadership characteristics of CUPBs. For purposes of this study, successful programming boards were defined and identified by professionals who work in this area of student affairs administration. To obtain the sample for this study, student affairs professionals who work with college and university programming boards and are members of the National Association of Campus Activities (NACA) were contacted. Members were asked to identify successful programming boards in their NACA region. Based on the programming boards identified through this process, the most successful programming boards for each of the seven NACA regions were identified. There were 22 total programming boards included in the study's sample. An Institutional Profile (IP) form was created with items that related to the research questions posed in this study. Document analysis was conducted on texts and reports obtained from advisors of the sample's programming boards. Additional information was obtained through interviews with these advisors. Responses that were qualitative in nature were analyzed and assigned to response categories. The data that were quantitative in nature were analyzed by calculating frequency and/or range and mean scores. The data revealed significant results for each of the seven characteristics explored in the study. The findings suggest ways to structure and staff CUPBs, how to select and train student leaders, how to manage human and financial resources, how to manage facilities, and the types and numbers of programs successful CUPBs sponsor. Recommendations about the mission of successful CUPBs were identified, as were ways to assess outcomes and advise the programming board. Collectively, the results describe the elements of successful CUPBs. These elements can be used to establish standards of practice for such boards and the staff who manage them.

Parents, teachers, and schools recognize the importance of the transition from preschool into kindergarten and its possible influence on children's adjustment and long term school success. However, as the philosophies and policies of kindergarten have emerged and evolved, so have the views of parents and teachers regarding children entering kindergarten. Research shows parents and teachers have conflicting views regarding the expectations for children in kindergarten. While the quality of a child's transition to kindergarten is an individual experience, there are some universal factors of influence in any transition. These factors include communication among teachers and parents and establishment of relationships among the three protagonistschild, parent, and teacher. Throughout this thesis, I present data that examines the expectations and concerns for the children entering kindergarten from a parent and educational perspective. I also provide transition activities practiced in the home and school environment. The most important aspect of the transition process involves focusing on the relationships between child and teacher, parents and teacher, child and peers, and child and parent. I include parent and educational perspectives of these relationships and relate how these relationships enhance children's transition into kindergarten.

The objective of this research was to develop recommended management practices for alfalfa-tall fescue mixtures and compare livestock performance, forage quality, and productivity of this mixture to N-fertilized endophyte-free tall fescue. Forty-eight Angus or Angus crossbred steers were rotationally stocked on a four-replicate alfalfa-tall fescue and N-fertilized tall fescue pasture system during 2002 and 2003. Livestock gain, forage quality, and forage production were monitored throughout the seasons. Management treatments conducted within wire exclosures included defoliation height, rest period, exclosure movement, and month and were evaluated using detailed botanical composition and persistence measurements. Defoliation height, rest period, and month all affected alfalfa-tall fescue competition. Alfalfa was generally more competitive with longer rest periods and shorter heights, although results were not consistent. Alfalfa composition and persistence declined dramatically over the 2003 season due to climate, grazing management, and cultivar. Cool, high moisture conditions stimulated tall fescue growth and reduced alfalfa vigor and survival. Livestock gains were higher for pure tall fescue at one date in 2002, but higher overall for alfalfa-tall fescue during 2003. Forage quality (CP, NDF and ADF) was consistently higher for alfalfa-tall fescue during both seasons. In conclusion, both alfalfa-tall fescue and N-fertilized endophyte-free tall fescue produce productive pastures and high ADG in beef steers in Virginia, but continued management research is required to maintain the alfalfa component of this mixture.

The study design consisted of twelve ophthalmically normal horses separated into three groups of four in a cross-over study design. Each group was treated for 5 days with flunixin meglumine (500mg IM bid), topical 1% prednisolone acetate (0.2ml tid), or topical oxytetracycline (0.2ml tid), followed by a 9-day washout period. All topical medications were applied to the left eye and the right eye was treated with a placebo. Tears were collected before the first treatment on day one and the morning following the last treatment on day 5. Tear film proteinase activity was measured using gelatin zymography and measurements of optical density. Statistical analysis of the difference between the treated and untreated eyes and the eyes before and after treatment was performed using mixed effects model for ANOVA. When eyes were compared after treatment, there was no significant difference between treated and placebo eyes for MMP-2 or MMP-9 for any of the treatments. When post-treated eyes were compared to pre-treated eyes, there was a significant decrease in MMP-2 activity in the left eye of horses treated with flunixin meglumine (P=0.0259). There were no differences in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity for the other treatments. In conclusion, topical 1% prednisolone acetate and topical oxytetracycline did not significantly change MMP-2 or MMP-9 activity in normal equine tear film. Systemic flunixin meglumine had an inhibitory, but questionable, effect on MMP-2 activity in normal equine tear film. This project was funded by Patricia Bonsall Stuart Award for Equine Research.

Therefore, removal of riparian vegetation associated with agricultural land use affects stream ecosystem structure and function. The objectives of this study were to measure and compare allochthonous input and leaf breakdown rates along a gradient of agricultural land use in southern Appalachian streams. Study streams were placed into the following land use categoriesforest and light, moderate, and heavy agriculture. Several physical, chemical, and biological parameters also were measured including discharge, temperature, nutrient concentrations, macroinvertebrate abundance and density, periphyton biomass, and chlorophyll a concentration. In forested, light agricultural, and moderate agricultural streams, the quantity and quality of allochthonous input were not significantly different. However, the timing and composition of allochthonous materials were related to land use. Chlorophyll a and periphyton biomass did not vary among land use types. Leaf breakdown rates were significantly faster in light and moderate agricultural streams in comparison to forested and heavy agricultural streams. Slow breakdown rates in forested streams resulted from low nutrient concentration and cool stream temperature. The scarcity of shredding macroinvertebrates and sedimentation probably limited leaf breakdown in heavy agricultural streams. Though limited riparian vegetation along agricultural streams resulted in an energy supply equivalent to forested streams, agricultural land use may still have long term impacts on stream structure including nutrient concentrations, temperature, macroinvertebrate community, and sedimentation thus affecting stream ecosystem function.

Even the literary histories and anthologies of Southern literature tend to down play his role as a man of letters and poet of consequence. This diminution of Hayne's literary reputation has taken place despite the respect for his poetry and criticism that came from leading poets and critics in the United States and England during the mid to late nineteenth century.  In this thesis, I analyze the neglect of Hayne's work by first outlining his reception history as a poet. Certain trends are evident, specifically a movement in the United States away from the Anglo-American tradition to a new style of poetry, best represented by Walt Whitman. This change in what was fashionable in poetry has had the effect of undermining Hayne's reputation as a poet. Moreover, Hayne's literary reputation became more tenuous after the War Between the States given his strong affiliation with the conquered Confederacy. To bolster my argument that Hayne's reputation ought not be left to the whims of literary fashion, I conduct a preliminary examination of Hayne's poetry by analyzing several poems. I conclude, after examining the evidence, that Hayne deserves inclusion in the literary canons of American and Southern literature as an important representative nineteenth-century Southern poet writing within the Anglo-American tradition.

The high data rate, especially, requires the use of bandwidth-efficient modulation schemes such as Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK). But modulation schemes such as QPSK need, in turn, a very linear power from the output of the transmitter power amplifier in order to meet the spectral requirements. A linear power amplifier, traditionally, has very low energy efficiency. Poor energy efficiency directly affects operational costs and causes thermal heating issues in base station transmitters. Thus the power amplifier designer is forced to trade-off between linearity and efficiency. As a result of this trade-off a Class-AB power amplifier is most often used in QPSK based systems. Class-AB power amplifiers provide acceptable linearity at efficiency values around 45-50% typically. This compromise is not a satisfactory solution but is inevitable while using traditional power amplifier design techniques. This thesis details the use of a Class-F amplifier with carefully chosen bias points and harmonic traps to overcome this problem. Class-F amplifiers are usually considered as very high efficiency (80% or more power-added efficiency) amplifiers where the high efficiency is obtained through the use of harmonic traps (L-C filters or quarter-wavelength transmission lines), which provide suitable terminations (either open or short) for the harmonics generated. By doing this, a square wave drain voltage and a peaked half-sinusoidal drain current out-of-phase by 180Âº are produced. Since only a drain voltage or a drain current exists at any given time, the power dissipation is ideally zero resulting in 100% theoretical efficiency. These very high efficiency values are usually associated with poor linearity. However the linearity can be improved to meet the design standards but compromising on efficiency. Even after this is done, efficiencies are usually 10 to 15% greater than a traditional Class AB power amplifier with similar linearity performance. Thus efficiency can be improved without affecting linearity by the use of Class-F power amplifiers.  In order to verify this theory, a Class-AB and a Class-F power amplifier are designed using Motorola's high voltage laterally diffused metal oxide semiconductor (LDMOS) transistor. The choice of bias points and the design of the harmonic traps are very critical for the Class-F performance and hence were designed after careful consideration. The designs were simulated on Agilent's Advanced Design System (ADS) and the simulated results were compared for three different power levels namely, the peak power, 3 dB below peak power and 6 dB below peak power. At all of these power levels it was noted that the Class-F and Class-AB power amplifiers have very similar linearity performance whereas the Class-F power amplifiers show about 10% improvement in efficiency in comparison to the Class-AB power amplifiers.

Driven by an ever-increasing recognition of the injustices of racial discrimination, Truman offered a comprehensive civil rights program to Congress on 2 February 1948. When his legislative proposals were rejected, he employed a unilateral policy of action despite grave political risk, and freed subsequent presidential nominees of the Democratic party from its southern segregationist bloc by winning re-election despite the States' Rights challenge of Strom Thurmond. The remainder of his administration witnessed a multi-faceted attack on prejudice involving vetoes, executive orders, public pronouncements, changes in enforcement policies, and amicus briefs submitted by his Department of Justice. The southern Democrat responsible for actualizing the promises of America's ideals of freedom for its black citizens is Harry Truman, not Lyndon Johnson. The shift in white American opinion necessary for the passage of the civil rights acts of the 1960s was generated by the cumulative effects of actions taken between 1945 and 1953.

This thesis presents the case for reinforcement learning (RL) as the framework of choice to realize reachability routing, within the confines of the current Internet backbone infrastructure. The setting of the reinforcement learning problem offers several advantages, including loop resolution, multi-path forwarding capability, cost-sensitive routing, and minimizing state overhead, while maintaining the incremental spirit of the current backbone routing algorithms. We present the design and implementation of a new reachability algorithm that uses a model-based approach to achieve cost-sensitive multi-path forwarding. Performance assessment of the algorithm in various troublesome topologies shows consistently superior performance over classical reinforcement learning algorithms. Evaluations of the algorithm based on different criteria on many types of randomly generated networks as well as realistic topologies are presented.

In particular, we focus on Prescriptive Formal Models (PFMs) that capture the specification of the system under design in a mathematically precise manner. Such models can be used as golden reference models for formal verification, test generation, etc. This methodology for incrementally building PFMs work by adding user stories (expressed as LTL formulae) gleaned from the natural language specifications, one by one, into the model. XFM builds the models, retaining correctness with respect to incrementally added properties by regressively model checking all the LTL properties captured theretofore in the model. We illustrate XFM with a graded set of examples including a traffic light controller, a DLX pipeline and a Smart Building control system. To make the regressive model checking steps feasible with current model checking tools, we need to keep the model size increments under control. We therefore analyze the effects of ordering LTL properties in XFM. We compare three different property-ordering methodologies'arbitrary ordering', 'property based ordering' and 'predicate based ordering'. We experiment on the models of the ISA bus monitor and the arbitration phase of the Pentium Pro bus. We experimentally show and mathematically reason that predicate based ordering is the best among these orderings. Finally, we present a GUI based toolbox for users to build PFMs using XFM.

In this study, we created two introductory undergraduate physical geology lab modules for calculating plate motion. One engages students with a model-driven approach using contrived data. Students are taught a descriptive model and work with a set of contrived data that supports the model. The other lab exercise uses a data-driven approach with real data. Students are given the real data and are asked to make sense of it. They must use the data to create a descriptive model. Student content knowledge and understanding of the nature of science were assessed in a pretest-posttest experimental design using a survey containing 11 Likert-like scale questions covering the nature of science and 9 modified true/false format questions covering content knowledge. Survey results indicated that students gained content knowledge and increased their understanding of the nature of science with both approaches. Lab observations and written interviews indicate these gains resulted from students experiencing different pedagogical approaches used in each of the two labs.

Spectrum is expensive, and newer technologies demand transmission of maximum amount of data with minimum spectrum usage. This requires sophisticated modulation techniques, leading to wide, dynamic signals that require linear amplification. Although linear amplification is achievable, it always comes at the expense of efficiency. Most of the modern wireless applications such as WCDMA use non-constant envelope modulation techniques with a high peak to average ratio. Linearity being a critical issue, power amplifiers implemented in such applications are forced to operate at a backed off region from saturation. Therefore, in order to overcome the battery lifetime limitation, a design of a high efficiency power amplifier that can maintain the efficiency for a wider range of radio frequency input signal is the obvious solution.  A new technique that improves the drain efficiency of a linear power amplifier such as Class A or AB, for a wider range of output power, has been investigated in this research. The Doherty technique consists of two amplifiers in parallel; in such a way that the combination enhances the power added efficiency of the main amplifier at 6dB back off from the maximum output power.  The classes of operation of power amplifier (A, AB, B, C etc), and the design techniques are presented. Design of a 2.14 GHz Doherty power amplifier has been provided in chapter 4. This technique shows a 15% increase in power added efficiency at 6 dB back off from the compression point. This PA can be implemented in WCDMA base station transmitter.

The FAO annually publishes a list of best and worst performing countries that respectively significantly decreased or increased the proportion of the population that was undernourished. Strikingly, seven out of ten global best performers and four out of ten global worst performers are located in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study therefore seeks to explore the variables affecting undernourishment rates, in an attempt to explain this variance.  Six case studies hence explored three best performers (Angola, Chad and Ghana) and three worst performers (Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo and Liberia) as the unit of analysis. Three clusters of variables were studied; natural shocks, agricultural production and economy. Changes in these variables were examined between 1992-2000 and Ragin's qualitative case study research strategy was applied to facilitate the analysis. The data indicated that the most influential variable was agricultural production. Furthermore, good governance leads to improvements in all three clusters of variables, whereas a civil war negatively effects all three clusters. Undernourishment proved to be a very complex and intertwined problem and similar research on a larger scale was recommended.

What are the impacts and challenges of ecotourism? What are the possible benefits that ecotourism can bring? Is ecotourism in Costa Rica sustainable?  Based on the guiding principles of ecotourism, a legitimate argument can be made that ecotourism in Costa Rica has not produced desired outcomes and is not sustainable. However, an equally strong argument can be made that although ecotourism may not currently be sustainable, it has yet to fully mature, and has shown signs that it can achieve a balance between development and conservation goals.. Ecotourism has more promise for achieving sustainability than alternative types of land use such as agriculture, cattle grazing, logging, or mass tourism. Whether or not ecotourism in Costa Rica will prove to be sustainable in the long-term remains to be seen.  In order to increase the likelihood that ecotourism achieves goals of sustainable development in Costa Rica, all of the key actors must to begin to take more proactive measures in order to ensure that ecotourism is carefully planned and implemented. Ecotourism must account for social, economic and environmental implications, in order to succeed. A much more balanced and integrated approach, founded on the guiding principles of sustainable development, is essential to maximize the benefits and minimize the negative impacts of ecotourism in Costa Rica.

Research over the past few decades has questioned the responsiveness of representative democratic institutions in advanced industrial democracies to individual and communal needs in society. Radical democratic theorists have called for direct action, structural reform, and other social and political changes to make democracy \"stronger.\" Increased education levels brought on by continued economic and physical security in advanced industrial societies has led to a change in the ability of citizens to access the political process. How the relationship between the citizen and the state is altered as a result of continued prosperity is a primary motivation for this research.   Working with World Values Survey data, I examine individual and societal level relationships between postmaterial values and direct political participation and acceptance of participatory values. Empirical evidence supports the hypotheses that postmaterial values are positively associated with direct political participation and as the level of Postmaterialists increases in a given society the level of participatory behavior and acceptance of participatory values will also increase. Substantive analysis suggests that increase in the level of postmaterialism in a country will lead to increases in alternative political activity and other forms of direct participation.

Pedon and soil interpretation record databases are used with soil and ecological maps to estimate regional SOC even though these databases are rarely complete for surface litter and mineral subsurface horizons.  The first main objective of the project is to improve the ability to produce soil organic carbon estimates from existing spatial soils datasets, such as STATSGO. All records in the STATSGO Layer table that were incomplete or appeared to be incorrectly filled with a null or zero value were considered invalid. Data sorting procedures and texture lookup tables were used to identify exiting correct (valid) data entries that were used to substitute invalid records. STATSGO soil property data were grouped by soil order, MLRA, layer number, and texture to produce replacement values for all invalid data used to calculate mass SOC. Grouping criteria was specific to each variable and was based on texture designations. The resulting filled and unfilled tables were used with procedures assuming Normal and Lognormal distribution of parameters in order to analyze variation of mass SOC estimates caused by using different computation techniques.  We estimated mass SOC to 2 m in Maine and Minnesota using filled and unfilled STATSGO data tables. Up to 54% of the records in Maine and up to 80% of the records in Minnesota contained null or zero values (mostly in fields related to rock fragments) that were replaced. After filling, the database resulted in 1.5 times higher area-weighted SOC. SOC calculated using the Normal distribution assumption were 1.2 to 1.5 times higher than those using the Lognormal transformation. SOC maps using the filled tables had more logical geographic SOC distribution than those using unfilled tables.  The USDA Forest Service collects and maintains detailed inventory data for the condition and trends of all forested lands in the United States. A wide range of researchers and landowners use the resulting Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database for analytical and decision making tasks. FIA data is available to the public in transformed or aggregate format in order to ensure confidentiality of data suppliers.  The second main objective of this project was to compute SOC (kg m-2) results by FIA forest type and forest type group for three depth categories (25 cm, 1 m, and 2 m) at a regional scale for the 48 contiguous United States. There were four sets of results derived from the filled STATSGO and FIA datasets for each depth class by region(1) SOC computed by the Lognormal distribution approach for (1a) all soil orders, (1b) without Histosols; and (2) SOC computed by the Normal distribution approach for (2a) all soil orders, (2b) without Histosols.  Two spatial forest cover datasets were relevant to this project, FIA and AVHRR. We investigated the effects of FIA inventory data masking for Maine and Minnesota, such as plot coordinates rounding to the nearest 100 arc-second, and the use of 1 km resolution satellite-derived forest cover classes from AVHRR data, on SOC estimates to 2 m by forest type group. SOC estimates by soil mapping unit were derived from fixed STATSGO database tables and were computed by the Lognormal distribution approach including all soil orders.  The methods in this study can be used for a variety of ecological and resource inventory assessments and the automated procedures can be easily updated and improved for future uses. The procedures in this study point out areas that could benefit the most during future revisions of STATSGO. The resulting SOC maps are dynamic and can be rapidly redrawn using GIS whenever STATSGO spatial or tabular data undergo updating. Use of pedon data to define representative values for all properties in all STATSGO layers and correlation of STATSGO layers to soil horizons will lead to vast improvement of the STATSGO Layer table and promote its use for mass SOC estimation over large regions.

This study was divided into two experiments. In the first experiment of this study, the hypothesis tested was normal horses would have minimal variability in the wheals formed by intradermal injection of positive control stimulants. This was evaluated by examining the repeatability of skin test wheals created by 5 concentrations of histamine, compound 48/80, and phaseolus vulgaris (PHA) within a normal horse and between 12 normal horses at 0.5 hours, 4 hours, and 24 hours post injection. Minimal variability was detected within individual horses and between 12 horses for histamine and compound 48/80 at 0.5 hours and for PHA at 4 hours. This information suggests that the intradermal injection of positive control substances is a repeatable test in normal horses. In the second experiment of this study, the hypothesis tested was normal horses react differently to intradermal injection of positive control stimulants (histamine, compound 48/80, PHA) and/or an environmental antigen (Aspergillus) in comparison to horses affected with RAO. This was evaluated by identifying differences in wheal responses between normal horses and RAO affected horses. Concentration response curves were created in normal and RAO affected horses to the aforementioned stimulants at 0.5 hours, 4 hours, and 24 hours post injection. No statistically significant differences were noted in concentration response between normal and ROA affected horses when compound 48/80 and PHA were evaluated. RAO affected horses demonstrated a greater slope at the 0.5 hour time when compared to normal horses suggesting that RAO affected horses are hypersensitive to intradermal injection of histamine. Injection of Aspergillus mix at 4000 protein nitrogen units/ml caused an intradermal wheal reaction at the 24-hour time in 4/5 RAO horses. This reaction was not noted in normal horses. This information suggests that there may be a positive relationship between causative antigens (i.e. Aspergillus) that may induce clinical RAO and positive intradermal skin test results.  An additional aspect that was evaluated in both experiments involved histologic examination of skin biopsies taken from wheals created by intadermal injection of histamine, compound 48/80, PHA, and Aspergillus at various times post injection. In the first experiment, intradermal injection of histamine caused severe dermal edema and margination of neutrophils and eosinophils at 0.5 hours. Compound 48/80 demonstrated mild to modest dermal edema at 0.5 hours while PHA demonstrated severe dermal edema, hemorrhage, and lymphactic ectasia at 4 and 24 hours. PHA also demonstrated a neutophilic inflammation at 4 hours that progressed to a mixed lymphohistiocytic and neutrophilic inflammation at 24 hours. In the second experiment, no edema and modest to moderate neutrophilic inflammation was noted in normal horses after intradermal injection of Aspergillus at 24 hours. In contrast, RAO affected horses demonstrated mild to modest edema and a mild to moderate mixed inflammatory response (lympho-histocytic, neutrophilic, eosinophilic) after intradermal injection of Aspergillus at 24 hours suggesting a delayed type response.

In addition, exploratory analyses looked at the impact of individual differences on attention (goal preference & action-state orientation). Analyses were conducted using three-level hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), where repeated measures occur within trials, which are nested within individuals. In general, results failed to support the hypotheses. However, weak support was found for attentional effects when commitment was also taken into consideration. Further, while commitment was not found to have the strong moderating influence on attention that was hypothesized, there is some evidence for its overall importance to the attentional mechanism of the goal/performance relationship.

This consideration motivates the search for new architectural paradigms based on redundancy based defect-tolerant designs. However, redundancy is not always a solution to the reliability problem, and often too much or too little redundancy may cause degradation in reliability. The key challenge is in determining the granularity at which defect tolerance is designed, and the level of redundancy to achieve a specific level of reliability. Analytical probabilistic models to evaluate such reliability-redundancy trade-offs are error prone and cumbersome, and do not scalewell for complex networks of gates. In this thesiswe develop different tools and techniques that can evaluate the reliability measures of combinational circuits, and can be used to analyze reliability-redundancy trade-offs for different defect-tolerant architectural configurations. In particular, we have developed two tools, one of which is based on probabilistic model checking and is named NANOPRISM, and another MATLAB based tool called NANOLAB. We also illustrate the effectiveness of our reliability analysis tools by pointing out certain anomalies which are counter-intuitive but can be easily discovered by these tools, thereby providing better insight into defecttolerant design decisions. We believe that these tools will help furthering research and pedagogical interests in this area, expedite the reliability analysis process and enhance the accuracy of establishing reliability-redundancy trade-off points.

The relationship between male dismissing attachment style and the presence of a pursuer-distancer pattern in the couple approached significance. Analyses of attachment style and the specific direction of the pursuer-distancer pattern as a couple-level variable were non-significant. However, when self-report of pursuer-distancer pattern was analyzed as an individual-level variable, a significant relationship was found between pursuing and a preoccupied attachment style and between distancing and a dismissing attachment style. Fearful attachment style was related to bi-directional pursuer-distancer pattern when measured by partner's report but not when measured by self-report. Dismissing and fearful attachment styles in males were related to lower relationship satisfaction in males and females. Pursuer-distancer patterns (particularly female-pursue and bi-directional patterns) were significantly related to lower relationship satisfaction in males and females. No relationship was found between attachment style or pursuer-distancer pattern report and the gender of the participant. Implications for treating pursuer-distancer patterns couples are discussed.

Additionally, nearly all computing systems, including control systems, enterprise applications, scientific codes and dynamic libraries operate eventually at the object code level. Studying adaptivity and runtime composition issues in such systems is becoming an important focus of systems research. In this thesis, we describe an object-level framework that will manipulate an object module to instrument control functionality and adaptivity in order to realize complex compositional scenarios. Using function and parameter remapping capabilities, our framework transcends programming language and design boundaries, and enables applications to adapt dynamically during runtime. We introduce the capability to \"restart\" an application automatically, a feature we utilize to support adaptivity not only spatially, over the algorithm domain, but temporally as well. A high-level adaptive control language based on XML is presented that allows complex adaptive scenarios to be expressed concisely. Additionally, the construction of several adaptive scenarios using our framework is illustrated, along with several experiments in ``learning adaptivity`` using reinforcement learning techniques.

Greenough's experience-expectant and experience-dependent model of development was used to examine EEG power values among infants with different levels of walking experience (non-walkers, novice, experienced). In accordance with this model, a trend was shown for novice walkers to have higher EEG power values than both non-walkers and experienced walkers only in the central region. Walkers were also found to score higher on an object retrieval (OR) spatial memory task than non-walkers, with amount of walking experience being inconsequential. In addition, infants who scored higher on the OR spatial memory task showed a trend for higher EEG power values in medial frontal, central and parietal areas than infants scoring lower on the OR task. This was not the case for the manual search spatial memory task (AB). There was no interaction among spatial memory performance, walking experience and brain electrical activity. The utility of OR as a spatial memory task that requires the integration of relevant perceptual-motor integration is discussed.

We tested this hypothesis in a silvopasture near Blacksburg, VA. In 1995, black walnut and honey locust trees were planted within plots (r=3) of predominantly tall fescue pasture. Across a 12% slope, trees were planted to create treatments of low, medium, and high tree densities at shoulder, mid, and toe slope positions within plots of honey locust and black walnut. Sampling sites (n=54) under tree density and slope position combinations were harvested May to October at 35-d intervals in 2002 and 2003 for determination of yield and nutritive value characteristics. Soil surface temperature, forage canopy temperature, soil moisture, and photosynthetically active radiation were measured to determine forage responses to field treatments as functions of resource allocation. Tree density had the greatest effect on forage production and nutritive value. Across both years, yields were 16% greater (P=0.0006) at medium density (6130 kg/ha) compared to forage mass at low (5280 kg/ha)) and high density (4970 kg/ha, SE=130). Increasing tree density did not affect (P>0.2) ADF, CP, P, K, and Mg levels, but reduced (P<0.001) NDF and TNC, and increased (P<0.0001) ADL and Ca. Elevated soil surface and forage canopy temperatures limited forage production and nutritive value at low density, while low light levels were the limiting factor at high density. Moderating forage microclimate with appropriately spaced trees is an effective way to improve forage production in temperate pastures.

The rooftops of urban buildings offer exciting opportunities for remedying these trends. New rooftop designs highlight the need for more plant life and green space in urban areas, improve energy efficiency, and offer urban residents gardens to enjoy and relax in. Rooftops can enhance buildings in urban areas through landscape design, transforming neglected space into valuable real estate that provides ecological and economic services. Well designed rooftops can enhance property values, assist with primary on-site storm water management, help build energy efficiency, mitigate the urban hear island effect, and filter air and water. A good green roof exists in symbiosis with its neighbors and the city at large. Contemporary rooftop design strives for an ethical stewardship of the earth.

Rudimentary zoning ordinances originated in New York around 1916 as a means of separating the lower class fabric markets from the upscale retailers of 5th Avenue nearby, and to reduce density. The Standard Enabling Acts of the 1920s granted governments the broad authority to enact zoning ordinances to reduce population densities in cities for the purposes of health, safety, and well being. The United States Supreme Court upheld this authority as constitutional in the landmark case of Euclid v. Ambler Realty (1926). In the roughly eighty years since the Euclid decision, zoning has become the planning profession's primary tool to regulate land use. While an effective policy response to issues at that time of a rapidly industrializing America, Euclidean zoning has unintentionally shaped the US landscape into a sprawling, auto-dependent society characterized by segregated communities of isolated populations.  Euclidean zoning makes it extremely difficult to mix uses. As a result, 'traditional' development patterns with high-density housing, nearby commercial, and pedestrian-friendly walkways are virtually impossible to create. Many critics suggest that zoning promulgates sprawl. In short, Euclidean zoning prevents 'good' urban design.  In recent years, new trends have emerged to address these problems to varying degrees of success. Form-Based Codes are one of the most recent planning innovations. With origins in the New Urbanist school of development, Form-Based Codes elevates physical design in city planning, as opposed to the 'use-based' restrictions of Euclidean zoning. This paper examines whether or not Form-Based Codes could be a viable solution to the ills associated with Euclidean zoning. Benefits and drawbacks of both Euclidean zoning and Form-Based Codes are debated, including a case study analysis, as well as a discussion of legal ramifications and future scenarios in land use planning.

But it alone can not explain all of these phenomena in societies. The concept of trust can not be neglected in the social capital literature. Considerable confusion exists concerning the relationship between social capital and trust, namely whether trust is a precondition of social capital or a product of it. This paper begins to explore their relationships by tracing the origins and development of the concept of social capital. It then discusses the relationship between social capital and trust by comparing their origins or sources. Finally, these two ideas are placed in organizational context to develop an analytical distinction between trust and social capital while clarifying and exploring the implications of these two primary perspectives on organizational effectiveness. The paper concludes that trust and social capital are mutually reinforcing -- social capital generates trusting relationships that in turn produce social capital.

This sandwich was available in a healthy combo including salad and water, and a regular combo including soda and fries. At all 3 locations, research assistants collected receipts showing all total menu item sales every day during the six-week intervention. Analyses of variance revealed consumers purchased the healthy sandwich significantly more during the incentive conditions, and also purchased the regular combo more frequently than the healthier combo during the intervention condition.

This usually results in a number of separate models that provide various views of a design, each of which is usually stored separately in proprietary formats. The problem is that the relationships between views (e.g., the circuit design that defines the functional connectivity between components, and the physical layout that provides physical paths to implement connections), are not explicitly captured. This makes it difficult to synchronize and maintain data consistency across all models as changes are made to the respective views. This thesis addresses this problem by describing power electronics modules using STEP AP210, the STandard for the Exchange of Product data, Application Protocol 210; which has been designated as ISO 10303-210. A multidisciplinary model was implemented for an integrated power electronics module (IPEM). It consists of two views of the IPEMa functional network definition of the IPEM, and a physical implementation that satisfies the functional connectivity requirements. The relationships between these two views are explicitly recorded in the model. These relationships allow for the development of a method which verifies whether the connectivity data in both views are consistent. Finally, this thesis provides guidance for deploying STEP AP210 to unify multidisciplinary data resources during the design of integrated power electronics.

In a field study, rimsulfuron was applied at 17.5 or 35 g ai/ha to perennial ryegrass in the afternoon; the following morning while dew was still present, a greens mower was driven through the perennial ryegrass and across adjacent creeping bentgrass. Irrigation had no effect on perennial ryegrass control but reduced visible track length and injury of neighboring creeping bentgrass. When treated perennial ryegrass was not irrigated prior to simulated mowing, tire tracks were evident on adjacent creeping bentgrass for up to 30 days. Gibberellic acid at 0.12 kg ai/ha and foliar iron at 1.3 kg ai/ha, applied to creeping bentgrass when tracks first appeared, did not enhance recovery of injured creeping bentgrass. Persistence and stability of [2-pyridine 14C] rimsulfuron on turf foliage was also assessed. Rimsulfuron was absorbed by annual bluegrass and perennial ryegrass equivalently and persisted equally on turf foliage. Water extractable rimsulfuron decreased from 60% at 10 minutes after treatment to 40% at 96 hours after treatment. A substantial amount of stable rimsulfuron persists on turf foliage for up to four days. Results from both studies suggest that when applying rimsulfuron near susceptible bentgrass the lowest effective rate should be used, and irrigation should follow two hours after treatment to prevent nontarget injury.

This study examines select programs within five arts disciplinesElders Share the Arts (theatre), Museum One (visual art), Liz Lerman Dance Exchange (dance), New Horizons Music (music), and Arts for the Aging (writing/literature). The selected programs serve a heterogeneous population of older adults and exist independently of larger, non-arts institutions, such as hospitals, nursing homes, or senior care facilities. Success factors were determined by three methods, including(1) direct questioning of program staff members about what they believed made their programs successful, (2) observations of program delivery to determine success factors in action, and (3) research and review of literature.  The conclusions of the aforementioned methods result in six universal factors among successful programming within arts programs. These common factors are1. Reminiscence regularly occurs among individual participants. Older adults who have the opportunity to reflect, without inhibition, on events from their past tend to experience more self-satisfaction, a reinforcement of their identity, and a ready connection with other adults. 2. Programs establish and maintain a safe, non-threatening environment. Allocating a small amount of time for everyone to acclimate to the new environment allows older adults to feel more at ease, encourages their participation, and increases their enjoyment. 3. Teaching artists are personally committed to the context in which they work and exhibit patience when engaging with older adults. Teaching artists find a balance between activities that are aesthetically enjoyable and educationally and socially rewarding. 4. Another organization or venue serves as a host for the program. This reciprocal relationship sustains the arts program and increases the vitality of the host organization by providing a wide range of programs. 5. The organization's leader is enthusiastic and mindful of both challenges and opportunities in the field. A single person in a highly-placed administrative position is identified as an essential driving force behind successful programs. 6. Teaching artists demonstrate loyalty by committing several years to the programs. The long-term retention of all teaching artists ensures consistent, reliable, and quality programs.

This thesis extends the reach of game-theoretic analysis to embrace link adaptation, thereby constituting a generalization of the power control problem. A realistic and natural problem formulation is attempted, wherein transmitter power and a discrete-valued Adaptable Link Parameter (ALP), e.g. code rate, constitute the action set of a player in this game. The dual goals of maximizing throughput and minimizing power consumption are reflected in the utility function selection, which uses the accurate sigmoid model for approximating throughput. The discrete action space makes it difficult to verify the existence of a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in this game using standard techniques. To circumvent this limitation, a heuristic algorithm is proposed. This algorithm is analytically shown to always converge to a NE. The subsequent results probe its validity and sensitivity. Favorable comparisons are drawn between these game-theoretic results and those arising from parallel systems techniques. A linear programming system optimization that exploits properties of the dominant eigenvalue of the system gain matrix is also presented in a comparative context.

While historically the domain of individuals outside the scholarly community - such as political strategists, pollsters, and journalists - presidential election forecasting has become increasingly mainstream, as a number of prominent political scientists entered the forecasting arena. With the goal of making accurate predictions well in advance of the November election, these forecasters examine several important election \"fundamentals\" previously shown to impact national election outcomes. In general, most models employ some measure of presidential popularity as well as a variety of indicators assessing the economic conditions prior to the election. Advancing beyond the traditional, non-scientific approaches employed by prognosticators, politicos, and pundits, today's scientific models rely on decades of voting behavior research and sophisticated statistical techniques in making accurate point estimates of the incumbent's or his party's percentage of the popular two-party vote. As the latest evolution in presidential forecasting, these models represent the most accurate and reliable method of predicting elections to date. This thesis provides an assessment of forecasting models' underlying epistemological assumptions, theoretical foundations, and methodological approaches. Additionally, this study addresses forecasting's implications for related bodies of literature, particularly its impact on studies of campaign effects.

Two flavors of UWB have recently emerged as strong contenders for the technology. One is based on Impulse Radio techniques extended to direct sequence spread spectrum. The other technique is based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing. Both schemes are analyzed in this thesis and modifications are proposed to increase the performance of each system. For both schemes, the issue of simultaneously operating users has been investigated. Current MAC design for UWB has relied heavily on existing MAC architectures in order to maintain backward compatibility. It remains to be seen if the existing MACs adequately support the UWB PHY (Physical) layer for the applications envisioned for UWB. Thus, in this work we propose a new MAC scheme for an Impulse Radio based UWB PHY, which is based on a CDMA approach using a code-broker in a piconet architecture. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared with the traditional CSMA scheme as well as the receiver-based code assignment scheme. A new scheme is proposed to increase the overall performance of the Multiband-OFDM system. Two schemes proposed to increase the performance of the system in the presence of simultaneously operating piconets (namely Half Pulse Repetition Frequency and Time spreading) are studied. The advantages/disadvantages of both of the schemes are discussed. ","description-provenance":["ETDs_20110726_kdweeks ","unrestricted ","Made available in DSpace on 2011-08-06T16:01:33Z (GMT).

These statistics have prompted government and corporate sponsored research into collision countermeasure systems that can enhance safety at intersections. Researchers are investigating technologies to provide an infrastructure-based or infrastructure-cooperative Intersection Decision Support (IDS) systems. Such systems would use pre-specified algorithms to identify drivers that have a high likelihood of violating the traffic signal and thus increase the risk of a collision. The system would subsequently warn the violating driver to stop though an in-vehicle or infrastructure-mounted interface. An IDS algorithm must be designed to provide adequate time for the driver to perceive, react, and stop the vehicle, while simultaneously avoiding a high false alarm rate.  Prior to developing these algorithms, scientists must understand how drivers respond to traffic signals. Little research has focused on the influence of driver state on red-light running behavior or methods for distinguishing red light violators from non-violators. The objective of the present study was to define trends associated with intersection crossings under different driver states and to explore the point detection method of predicting red light running upstream of the intersection. This was accomplished through a test-track mixed-factor experiment with 28 participants. Each participant experienced a baseline (complete a full stop at the red light), distracted (misses signal phase change due to inattention), and willful (driver knowingly makes a late crossing in an attempt to 'beat the light') driver state conditions. To provide the opportunity for red-light running behavior from participants, the amber change interval began at five different distances from the intersection. These distances were located near and within the dilemma zone, a region in which drivers have a difficult time deciding whether to go or to stop. Data collected from in-vehicle sensors was statistically analyzed to determine significant effects between driver states, and to investigate point detection algorithms.

The present project explored the feasibility of preferential hyperthermia as a method of treating deep seated tumors. The overall goal of this research was to determine theoretically if preferential heating could be used to attain the desired thermal dose (DTD) for a two cm diameter tumor.  The simulations in this work show that, when using a single silicon carbide insert, the model cannot provide enough energy for an entire 2 cm diameter tumor to receive the DTD. However, when using an enhanced design model with multiple (4) silicon carbide inserts, the DTD could be attained in a tumor up to 3.5 cm in diameter.  This study involved using the commercially available software package ANSYS 7.0 program to model a spherical 2 cm tumor, assuming the tumor is located in deep tissue with a constant perfusion rate and no major blood vessels nearby. This tumor was placed in the center of a cube of healthy tissue. To achieve the preferential heating of the tumor, a silicon carbide insert was placed in the center of the tumor and microwave energy was applied to the insert (in the form of volumetric heating). The thermal modeling of this system was based on the Pennes Bioheat equation with a maximum temperature limitation of of 80 ºC. The Thermal Dose Analyzer software program was used to evaluate the results of the thermal simulations (from ANSYS) to determine if the DTD had been attained.  Additional enhanced design models were also examined. These models include 2 cm and 4 cm tumors with four silicon carbide inserts symmetrically placed about the tumor and a 4 cm tumor model using a single silicon carbide insert with antennae attached to the insert to increase energy distribution to the tumor. The simulations show that only the enhanced design cases with four silicon carbide inserts can achieve the DTD for an entire 2 cm tumor.

Its success in this endeavor has been mixed. Through an analysis of three different humanitarian relief operations-the Rwanda genocide in 1994, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's intervention in Kosovo in 1999, and the floods of 2000 in Mozambique-this paper describes more fully the conditions under which coordination efforts occur. Specifically, this essay argues that successful and effective coordination in each particular crisis depends on the extent to which certain capacity and contextual conditions were present. In addition, it suggests that the often-touted \"coordination by command\" approach, a top-down style of coordination, should not be assumed by the UN since, as the literature suggests, this notion is quite contentious among nongovernmental organizations and United Nations staff alike.

However, traditional in lab evaluation has its drawbacks such as availability of representative end users, high cost of testing and lack of true representation of a user's actual work environment. To counteract these issues various alternative and less expensive usability evaluation methods (UEMs) have been developed over the past decade. One such UEM is the Remote Usability Evaluation method.  Remote evaluation is a relatively new area and lacks empirical data to support the approach. The need for empirical support was addressed in this study. The overall purpose of this study was to determine the differences in the effectiveness of the two evaluation types, the remote evaluation approach (SREM) and the traditional evaluation approach, in collecting usability data. This study also compared the effectiveness between the two methods based on user type, usability novice users and usability experienced users. Finally, the hypothesis that users, in general, will prefer the remote evaluation approach of reporting to the traditional in-lab evaluation approach was also tested. Results indicated that, in general, the synchronous remote approach is at least as effective as the traditional in lab usability evaluation approach in collecting usability data across all user types. However, when user type was taken into consideration, it was found that there was a significant difference in the high severity negative critical incident data collected between the two approaches for the novice user group. The traditional approach collected significantly more high severity negative critical incident data than the remote approach. Additionally, results indicate that users tend to be more willing to participate in the same approach as the one they participated previously. Recommendations for usability evaluators for conducting the SREM approach and areas for future research are identified in the study.

However, in light of recent pressures in the very competitive and practical aspects of academic life, the scholarly conversation is often lost amidst the desire to find any obscure point on which to publish simply for the reason that no one has yet said anything about it. There is certainly a usefulness to exploring all facets of Chaucer's work, but there is also a need to slough off the cumbersome coat of 'publish-or-perish' scholarship in favor of carrying on a more meaningful conversation which may contribute to new readings or interpretations, epiphanies, or canon-altering revelations. This bibliography was begun for two purposes. First, as a bibliography, it was made to serve its users in a convenient and comprehensive manner. Second, it was made to illustrate the conversations of recent years, or lack thereof, among scholars concerned with the character and actions of Criseyde in the Troilus. Criseyde is arguably the quintessential character in Chaucer's works. She is wonderfully enigmatic, and her role in the Troilus spawned six hundred years of debate. The chapters which follow testify to the complexity of Criseyde. As she caught the eye of multiple authors from classical antiquity to the Elizabethan age, she continues to entice scholars to read and re-read her in various articles, chapters, and books. This is supported by the fact that nearly one quarter of all scholarship published (over four hundred works) on Troilus and Criseyde since 1986 deals expressly with Criseyde, herself. This bibliography is constructed as it is in the hope of providing a more convenient tool for scholars. The Riverside Chaucer serves as an adequate starting point because of its comprehensive compilation of notes and studies on Chaucer's works, including the Troilus. Since nothing of similar stature has appeared since, this bibliography will begin in 1986, the year in which the Riverside's compilation came to an end. Chapter 1 of this study looks at recent scholarship which examines the origins of Chaucer's Criseyde. While W.W. Skeat and R.K. Root provided us long ago with detailed lists and accounts of Chaucer's sources for the Troilus, today's scholars continue to make new additions to these, as well as new interpretations and readings which suggest further, new or different sources. The final chapter of this work examines the scholarship that reads Criseyde's role in the poem as a whole, not focusing on any one scene or act. Scholars such as David Aers and Jill Mann provide critiques on the nature of Criseyde from our initial sight of her in Book I to her final departure from the poem in Book V. Interestingly, recent scholarship on Criseyde tends to focus on one or more specific scenes in a specific book within the poem. Scholars deconstruct Criseyde's entrance at the Palladium in Book I, her reaction to Pandarus' goading her to love Troilus in Book II, or descriptions of her dress in the Greek camp in Book IV. Therefore, in structuring this bibliography, rather than focusing on themes, I sought to frame the scholarship with the poem's own narrative structure. Thus, chapters two, three, four, and five are comprised of scholarship that examines Books I, II, III, and Books IV and V of the Troilus. Users who question certain scenes in one of the poem's books can then look to the corresponding chapter of this bibliography to find whether scholars have conversed about the scene or scenes in question. In a sense, this bibliography examines Criseyde's existence prior to Chaucer's poem, her activity within Chaucer's poem, and her reputation upon exiting Chaucer's poem. This bibliography seeks to put scholarship together in such a way as to confirm whether or not scholars are continuing conversations about Chaucer's Criseyde. In many cases we find that conversations do exist and are carried forward. New landmarks in scholarship, for example Piero Boitani's edited collection The European Tragedy of the Troilus or David Aers' Community, Gender, and Individual Identity, are made apparent by the number of other scholars conversing on arguments and suggestions made by the contributing authors of these two works. Scholars pick up where their predecessors leave off in continuing arguments, patterns of interpretation, and close readings of Criseyde. Further, scholars begin new conversations. In some instances, both old and new conversations fail to move forward, whether by mischance or 'entente.' It is essential that we continue these colloquial discussions of scholarship as the critical scope of Chaucer studies widens, rather than rocketing forward as it did with the work of Skeat, Root, Donaldson, and Robertson in the early and mid twentieth-century. Certainly, we can disagree, but let us remember the ease with which C.S. Lewis discusses Medieval literature in his Discarded Image and the warmth of a conference session at MLA, NCS, or Kalamazoo, in which Chaucerians gather to move forward as one body rather than a mix of warring clans, prima donnas, or renegade dissenters.  Scholarship aside, I offer this bibliography lastly to demonstrate the wonders of Chaucer's poetic arts and their chief exemplar, Criseyde.

One of the interesting aspects of life in Bangalore is 'public life' and the use of public space. However the quality of public spaces in Bangalore has deteriorated over the years due to several reasons. Rapid development, increase in traffic, encroachment into public spaces and lack of management of public spaces have all contributed to this. The CBD (Central Business District) area, especially M.G. Road has evolved as the de-facto centre of Bangalore. Hence a space that used to cater to a city of 2 million in 1980 has to now cater to a city of 5 million. This has led to congestion on M.G. Road, especially along the sidewalk, where people jostle each other to get to their destinations and one can no longer take a leisure stroll or promenade in comfort. Although the sidewalk has been historically an important public space, it is now slowly being reduced to the function of circulation. The increase in population has also altered the demands on public spaces in Bangalore. The cosmopolitan image that Bangalore has acquired has resulted in the creation of many eclectic spaces such as pubs, open-air cafÃ©s, and food courts. The common man is being left out of this semi-public realm because of affordability, causing a social rift. Also with pressure increasing on the streets it is becoming difficult to cater to these needs in an appropriate manner. The public realm is slowly diminishing and the semi-private realm is filling the void. This calls for a re-evaluation of the role of a street and how it is functioning in Bangalore and exploration of new spatial types of public spaces, which can be introduced in the public realm. Public spaces should reconcile these differences rather than aggravate them. With pressure on land due to increasing population and density a contest for space is inevitable. What is important is to reconcile these differences and evolve a strategy through which public space can be returned to the people irrespective or religion, caste, creed, class or political alignment for the common good without compromising on aesthetics. At the same time the poor and deprived need to feel a sense of belonging and ownership in the city. Public space is one of the few mediums for such expressions and hence the duty of the city to provide it.  Also the absence of iconic public spaces as landmarks has resulted in Bangalore remaining an imageless city, a former middle-class city with no apparent vernacular. Today Bangalore has no real city centre to represent its image and cater to its citizens. The elements of a city centre already exist as observed by Rao & Tewari; it is a matter of giving it structure and a sense of place. Bangalore today confronts several problems with respect to its public spaces ' lack of an imageable city centre; contest for urban and public space based on class and caste; privatisation / corporatisation of public space. To curtail violent and disruptive demonstration of ideas and aspirations by various interest groups especially those of the suppressed, the city needs a democratic, civic space in the perceived/evolving heart of the city ' M.G. Road. Such a space would attempt to bridge the zoning of Bangalore and the lack of imageability of the city; providing its citizens a space to speak their minds, to protest, to celebrate, to mourn, to recreate and most importantly to unite.  The thesis document comprises three sections. The first section deals with theory pertaining to the design of public spaces that provides a basis to evaluate public spaces in Bangalore, and draw conclusions, which can be applied in the design project. It draws from public space theory pertaining to the issues identified earlier. The second section provides a brief history of urbanisation of Bangalore. It describes the use of public space from colonial times to the present and draws conclusions for future development of public spaces in Bangalore. The last section applies and tests the conclusions arrived at in the previous two chapters through a design project for a site on Mahatma Gandhi Road. The design process and final product comprises the third section. ","description-provenance":["ETDs_20110726_kdweeks ","unrestricted ","Made available in DSpace on 2011-08-06T16:01:34Z (GMT).

Through interviews of white fans at politically conscious rap shows it was found that many individuals do not understand the music they are consuming is political in intent. Individuals highlighted themes that they could identify with, namely the need for unity and love, while ignoring others, such as the need to fight against injustice and racism. While independently individuals may have liberal political beliefs and consume politically conscious rap music, there appears to be no indication that consumption of rap music alters political beliefs.

Earlier research has concentrated on using epidemiological models to predict the number of computers a worm will infect and how long it takes to do so. In this research, one possible approach is outlined for predicting the spatial flow of a worm within the local area network (LAN).  The approach in this research is based on the application of mathematical models and variables inherent in plant epidemiology. In particular, spatial autocorrelation has been identified as a candidate variable that helps predict the spread of a worm over a LAN. This research describes the application of spatial autocorrelation to the geography and topology of the LAN and describes the methods used to determine spatial autocorrelation. Also discussed is the data collection process and methods used to extract pertinent information. Data collection and analyses are applied to the spread of three historical network worms on the Virginia Tech campus and the results are described. Spatial autocorrelation exists in the spread of network worms across the Virginia Tech campus when the geographic aspect is considered. If a new network worm were to start spreading across Virginia Tech's campus, spatial autocorrelation would facilitate tracking the geographical locations of the spread. In addition if an infection with a known value of spatial autocorrelation is detected, the characteristics of the worm can be identified without a complete analysis.

This interest is in part motivated by the notion that the use of large bandwidth signals makes systems less sensitive to the degrading effects of multipath propagation. By reducing the sensitivity to multipath, more robust and higher capacity systems can be realized. However, as signal bandwidth is increased, the complexity of a Rake receiver (or other receiver structure) required to capture the available power also increases. In addition, accurate channel estimation is required to realize this performance, which becomes increasingly difficult as energy is dispersed among more multipath components. In this thesis we quantify the channel response for six signal bandwidths ranging from continuous wave (CW) to 1 GHz transmission bandwidths. We present large scale and small scale fading statistics for both LOS and NLOS indoor channels based on an indoor measurement campaign conducted in Durham Hall at Virginia Tech. Using newly developed antenna positioning equipment we also quantify the spatial correlation of these signals. It is shown that the incremental performance gains due to reduced fading of large bandwidths level off as signals approach UWB bandwidths. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of Rake receivers for the different signal bandwidths and compare their performance for binary phase modulation (BPSK). It is shown that the receiver structure and performance is critical in realizing the reduced fading benefit of large signal bandwidths. We show practical channel estimation degrades performance more for larger bandwidths. We also demonstrate for a fixed finger Rake receiver there is an optimal signal bandwidth beyond which increased signal bandwidth produces degrading results.

For this model, the desired traction/slip is maintained for a specific surface which happens to be a Lego treadmill platform. How the platform evolved and the robot car was designed are also covered.  To parameterize the system dynamics, simulated annealing is used to find the minimal error between mathematical simulations and physical test results. Also discussed is how the robot car and microprocessor can be modeled as a hybrid system. The results from testing the robot car at various desired percent slip show that it is possible to control the slip dynamics of a 1/10th scale automated robotic car and thus pave the way for further studies using scaled model cars to test an automated highway system.

At the same time, success in public education and community involvement has encouraged grass-root movements that engage people in stream restoration efforts.  Stroubles Creek is a freshwater stream located in Blacksburg, Virginia. The creek has experienced considerable disturbance due to land use changes over the past 100 years. The Stroubles Creek Water Initiative (SCWI), originated by the Virginia Water Resources Research Center at Virginia Tech, has been monitoring the creek for a number of years. This paper develops a planning framework for restoring and/or rehabilitating Stroubles Creek within the Town of Blacksburg. The results of stream monitoring and other research by SCWI are used to inform the recommended planning process, while a literature review and discussion of “urban stream restoration case studies” are used to guide future decision-making related to Stroubles Creek restoration/rehabilitation.

Trust, norms and social networks, constitute the three major components of social capital. These three factors interact together and play a significant role in transactions between people and organizations. However, there is no consensus about the influence of social capital on transaction costs. Some researchers have stated that social capital could reduce transaction costs associated with adapting, monitoring and enforcing transactions; some have analyzed the negative impacts of social capital on transaction costs; and still some have focused on transaction costs in the formation of social capital. Using organizations as the unit of analysis and concentrating on trust, this paper analyzes how trust, the central concept of social capital, impacts transaction costs in inter-organizational transactions. At the same time, it is argued that trust building is costly, and some activities that constitute transaction costs help to form a mutual-trust between organizations. Further, the paper points out that transaction costs and trust differ depending on the characters of transactions.  The paper also studies the lock-in effects of trust on inter-organizational relationships and the role of intermediaries to mitigate the negative impacts. Finally, the paper intends to find policy and strategy implications for organizations and government to build a healthy and vigorous transaction environment.

Population shifts and changing land consumption patterns caused by advancements in technology, such as the Interstate and the Internet, along with social and economic factors, alter downtown development. The city, and particularly its downtown, used to represent the nucleus for all commercial, retail, and industrial activities. As population and commerce suburbanized, the 'central' business district became one of several business centers and lost much of its retail function. Currently, cities are re-evaluating their development strategies to determine the best methods to attract people back to the urban core and to regain the vitality that once defined city life.  Efforts to redevelop downtowns typically assume the characteristics of place-based strategies by following either infrastructure strategies or consumer strategies. The former method is more traditional, with attention given to specific land uses, such as residential, retail, or entertainment activities. Essentially, infrastructure strategies rely on the 'build it and they will come' motto. Consumer strategies strive to attract young professionals, single-parent families, and \"empty nesters\" for urban living by accentuating amenities unique to the city lifestyle.  Roanoke, Virginia serves as a case study for evaluating suburbanization trends and methods of redevelopment for a small- to medium-sized city. By calculating and analyzing household and office employment projections, the Roanoke market shows signs of strength among young, renter households and Central Business District office employment. With a downtown residential market emerging and downtown office employment growing, adaptive reuse of urban space may prove to be Roanoke's method of reinventing its downtown by orchestrating a consumer-based redevelopment effort.

First, lightweight designs for acoustic devices such as Helmholtz resonators and loudspeakers used for noise control in rocket payload compartments are developed. Second, active control using a hybrid control system (with structural and acoustic actuators) was tested experimentally. Due to the weight limitations for this application, Helmholtz resonators and loudspeakers are re-designed in order to reduce the device weight as much as possible while maintaining performance. For Helmholtz resonators, this is done by modeling the resonator for different structural shapes, wall materials and wall thicknesses using a finite element analysis software. The final design is then compared to the rigid resonators and is shown to perform effectively. These designs are then successfully applied to the full-scale fairing at Boeing facilities. In order to design a lightweight loudspeaker, a comparative approach was used. A standard 12' loudspeaker is taken as the reference loudspeaker and weight reduction solutions are applied to it while maintaining performance. The loudspeaker is characterized using mechanical, electrical and acoustical theories, and an optimization process is applied in order to minimize a defined cost function, which was taken as the total sound pressure output over a targeted frequency range per mass of the actuator. The results are used to build a lightweight loudspeaker together with a lightweight box, and the new designs are tested for comparison with the reference loudspeaker and shown to increase performance by 1.7 dB over 60-200 Hz band while reducing the mass by 78%. The second part of this thesis investigates the performance of a hybrid active control treatment featuring distributed vibration absorbers (DAVAs) and loudspeakers applied on a scale payload fairing. Several aspects such as causality, reference signals, and maximum controllable levels of this feedforward control scheme are the subjects of analyses. The results show that this active control approach can achieve significant amount of interior noise attenuation, and the total actuator weight required to control an external level of 138 dB can be reduced to 9.2kg using lightweight loudspeakers. However, it is shown that the attenuation levels can still be improved further by actuator positioning that gives more effective coupling of the actuators with the structural and acoustic modes and by using multiple references for the control system.

The Appomattox River watershed is primarily undeveloped with 70.8% of the land forested, 17.0% used for agriculture (mainly livestock production), and 7.7% classified as water, wetland or barren land. The remaining 4.5% is developed for residential, commercial, and industrial land uses (mainly within the city of Petersburg). Using Antibiotic Resistance Analysis, a known source library of 1,280 E. coli isolates (320 isolates per source) was constructed. Water samples were collected monthly for between eleven and fourteen months (11/02-12/03) from 40 locations throughout the Appomattox watershed and analyzed for fecal coliforms, E. coli, and resistance to 7 antibiotics of varying concentrations. A total of 486 water samples (9,907 isolates) were analyzed during the study. The objectives of this study were verify that each sampling site exceeded state bacterial count standards (using fecal coliform data), to compare the Discriminate Analysis and Logistic Regression statistical models for use in the classification of isolates, and finally to determine the source of contamination at each site.  The fecal coliform and E.coli data was used to determine if each site exceeded state standards during the assessment period. Thirty-eight of the sites exceeded the fecal coliform standard at least 10% of the time, and thirty-three exceeded the E.coli standard at least 10% of the time. Discriminate Analysis (DA) is typically used to classify isolates, but the results obtained from the DA model were unrealistic based on the watershed land uses. By statistically analyzing the original 1,280 E.coli isolates six different ways, a more appropriate classification of isolates was determined. The six analyzing methods were Regular DA and Logistic Regression (LR); DA and LR where each isolate whose probability fell below 80% was deleted; DA and LR where each isolate whose probability fell below 80% was used to create an Unknown category. The Logistic Regression model with an Unknown category proved to be the most appropriate. By using the Logistic Regression model, with Unknown category, to classify isolates, twenty five of the forty sites were discovered to be contaminated predominately with Livestock and fourteen of the sites predominately by Wildlife. One site was equally divided between these two categories. Human and Pet contamination were not dominant at any of the forty sites.  This comparison of the DA and LR statistical methods could change the analysis standard for Bacterial Source Tracking and suggests that the model required to classify isolates depends on the watershed characteristics.

While much of the literature on the decline in marriage among African Americans focuses on the sex ratio of males to females, these YHF African American women were much more concerned about the eligibility of the men in the dating pool than the ratio of males to females. They are looking for mates who share their core values of spirituality, goal oriented, family oriented and they are looking for supportive partners.

Redevelopment efforts in the past, such as urban renewal and large-scale redevelopment projects, have often jeopardized the vitality of downtowns. The difference between the urban catalyst and these redevelopment strategies is that catalytic redevelopment is a holistic approach, not a clean-slate approach, to revitalizing the urban fabric. Many cities have considered urban catalysts as a means for revitalization. Among the most noted catalytic projects are sports stadiums and arenashowever not all catalytic projects have to be designed at such a grand scale, nor do all cities possess a threshold of support to successfully sustain such developments.  This thesis design project examines the significance of the urban catalyst as a means of urban revitalization. The urban catalyst theory says design can be linked to place through the study of contextual factors in urban design. These factors includemorphological, social, functional, perceptual, visual, and temporal. For the urban catalyst to respond to its setting it also must possess a strong sense of place and authenticity.   Each component of my research supports my position that each city has unique attributes that can serve as basic models or seeds for urban redevelopment. These components are used as a basis for developing a design framework that is applied to two sites in Memphis, Tennessee.  This position is tested through the contextual analysis and design of two projects that are of major significance to Downtown Memphis, Tennessee. The first demonstrates the role that Court Square plays as a critical social and spatial element in the revitalization of the center city. The second is the revitalization of the South Side Neighborhood, an area full of history and character.

Southern yellow pine (SYP) adherends were used with epoxy and phenol formaldehyde (PF) impregnated films, providing two systems with different characteristics for investigation.  An adhesive penetration analysis was performed for both the epoxy and PF bonds. The PF penetration into the SYP was shown to be relatively shallow. The epoxy penetration was shown to be deeper. Epoxy-SYP DCBs were quasi-statically tested with varying widths (10 mm, 15 mm, and 20 mm), showing decreases in scatter of critical and arrest strain energy release rates, GIc and GIa, with increases in specimen width. Quasi-static fracture testing was also performed on PF SYP-DCBs, showing much higher critical and arrest fracture energy values than the epoxy-SYP DCBs, indicating that deep adhesive penetration is not necessarily a requisite for higher Mode I fracture energy values. Grain distribution influences were computationally investigated because of the stiffness difference between latewood and earlywood growth and the grain angle along the length of the beams. The grain angle and the stiffness difference between latewood and earlywood growth caused the effective stiffness, (ExxI)eff, to vary along the length of the beam. The effective stiffness variation caused variations in the beam's ability to receive and store strain energy, complicating and confounding determination of experimental results. Cyclic loading tests were performed on PF-SYP DCB's. The cycle frequency was 3Hz, with a valley to peak load ratio of R = 0.5. Specimen softening was observed with cycling, with re-stiffening occurring with crack growth. Contrary to expectations, specimen compliance occasionally decreased with small crack extensions. A toughening mechanism was frequently observed, whereby subsequent crack lengths required more cycles to failure than the previous crack length. Monotonically extending the crack length far from the fatigued region created a fresh crack that did not show the toughened behavior. But toughening did resume with subsequent crack lengths.

The motivation of this thesis was based on the adjacent spectrum allocations between the Virginia Tech terrestrial Local Multiple Distribution Service (LMDS) system and a Ka-band satellite system, and potentially being able to provide as an additional Ka-band satellite network backbone to the Virginia Tech terrestrial LMDS system for better and faster communications deployments. The Spaceway satellite systemÂ¡Â¦s design parameters were adopted typically for a Ka-band satellite system. The LMDS system was assumed to use IEEE 802.16 standard protocols although it currently uses its own proprietary protocols.  Four possible topologies integrating both terrestrial and satellite network were investigated. The study showed that the task was more problematic and complicated than anticipated due to incompatible network protocols, limitations of available hardware components, the high path loss at Ka-band, and the high cost of the equipment, although the adjacent frequency bands do suggest a possible integrated network.  In this thesis, the final selected topology was proposed and designed. The technical characteristics of the earth station used for coupling both terrestrial and satellite networks were determined by a link budget analysis and a consideration of network implementations. The reflector antenna used by the earth station was designed. In addition, other system design concerns and engineering tradeoffs, including adjacent satellite interference, rain attenuation, antenna pointing error, noise temperature, and modulation and multiple access selection, were addressed.

This is mainly due to the fact that the diagnostic techniques used are rough estimates made by angles defined by observations of 2-D radiographs. By utilizing the latest software, our research is based on designing a tool that creates a 3-D representation of the spine. When creating a three-dimensional spinal model, it becomes possible to determine local curvature and local torsion values at each specific vertebrae. By manipulating these values at discrete locations on the spine, one can generate \"virtual\" spines in a three-dimensional environment.  The Scoliosis Learning Tool includes algorithmic steps that determine the Lenke Classification of the \"virtual\" spines. The Lenke Classification is the most commonly accepted method for diagnosing spinal deformities. This patient building program will produce a group of spines with random values for curvature, torsion and initial spinal orientation. An algorithm within the software determines the Lenke Classification of each, and discards any curves that appear unnatural. By defining a metric that places an emphasis on certain geometric similarities, the software is able to define diameters of classification groups and separations between different classification groups. In turn it is possible to determine minor to major differences between spines within the same classification. In doing so, the opportunity exists to possibly find an undiscovered deformity that had previously fallen under another classification category.

Work-family conflict affects the individuals suffering from it, their families, and their employers. Thus, it is important to have a robust and comprehensive causal model that explains how these consequences arise so as to help all parties involved to prevent these consequences. The purpose of the present study was to test a comprehensive model of work-family conflict by examining the work, non-work and stress related consequences of work-family conflict using a sample of 181 Jamaican High School teachers. The results indicated that all hypothesized correlations but one were significant and in the direction predicted. However, the proposed model did not demonstrate good fit with the data. Post hoc revisions to the original model provided support for some of the initial hypotheses, thereby suggesting that work family conflict did predict job and life stress, among others. Overall, these findings indicate that work-family conflict results in work, non-work and stress related consequences that are evidenced in a complicated network of direct and indirect relationships. The results suggest that the consequences of work-family conflict may be best reduced by making attempts to prevent or eliminate a consequence that occurs early in the chain. A discussion of these and other implications are presented, and suggestions made for future research.

At the Center for Power Electronic Systems (CPES), a new approach to power electronic design is being implemented with the Integrated Power Electronic Module (IPEM). It is believed that an IPEM-based design approach will significantly enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. electronics industry, revolutionize the power electronics industry, and overcome many of the technology limits in today's industry by driving down the cost of manufacturing and design turnaround time. But with increased component integration comes the increased risk of component failure due to overheating. This thesis addresses the issues associated with the thermal management of integrated power electronic devices.  Two studies are presented in this thesis. The focus of these studies is on the thermal design of a DC-DC front-end power converter developed at CPES with an IPEM-based approach. The first study investigates how the system would respond when the fan location and heat sink fin arrangement are varied in order to optimize the effects of conduction and forced-convection heat transfer to cool the system. The set-up of an experimental test is presented, and the results are compared to the thermal model. The second study presents an improved methodology for the thermal modeling of large-scale electrical systems and their many subsystems. A zoom-in/zoom-out approach is used to overcome the computational limitations associated with modeling large systems. The analysis performed in this paper was completed using I-DEAS©,, a three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) program which allows the thermal designer to simulate the affects of conduction and convection heat transfer in a forced-air cooling environment.

This independent structural health monitoring system incorporates a low power wireless transmitter that sends a warning signal when damage is detected in a structure. Two damage detection techniques were implemented on the SHM system and successfully used for evaluating structural damage. The first impedance-based technique is used to detect a gouge introduced to a composite plate. The second technique is a modal parameter technique that analyzes shifts in natural frequency; this technique was used to detect structural changes in an aluminum cantilever beam. In additional to the above test structures, an aircraft rib provided by the United States Air Force was also tested. This test was performed using the HP 4192A impedance analyzer so that the advantage of high frequency impedance-based tested could be demonstrated.  Insight is given into the power characteristics of SHM systems and the need to incorporate power harvesting into these SHM devices is addressed. Also, a comparison between digital signal processors and microprocessors is included in this document.

The economic implications of such an incresae are far ranging; from decreased grinding costs and increased recoveries to simplified flow-sheet design and increased throughput, all leading to increased revenue. Bubble-particle detachment has been studied to better understand the factors influencing the strength of attachment and the energies involved. Direct measurements of bubble particle detachment were performed using a hanging balance apparatus (KSV Sigma 70 tensiometer) and using a submerged hydrophobic plate in water. Three experiments were used; direct force measurement of bubble-particle detachment, detachment force and energy of a bubble from a submerged hydrophobic plate, and detachment force and energy of a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide coated silica sphere from a flat bubble. Octadecyltrichlorosilane was used as a hydrophobic coating in the first two experimental methods. These experiments were recorded with a CCD camera to identify the detachment processes involved. Energies for both methods were calculated and divided into the two main steps of the detachment processThree-Phase-Contact pinning and three phase contact line sliding. The first step represents the energy barrier which must be overcome before detachment can begin. It is directly related to contact angle hysteresis. Detachment occurs during the second step, where the solid-vapor interface is replaced by solid-liquid and liquid-vapor. This step corresponds to the work of adhesion. The effects of surface tension, contact angle and hysteresis were well demonstrated with the three experimental methods. Good correlation was found between theoretical work of adhesion and measured energies.

The objective of this research is to develop a virtual acoustic showroom using a multi- speaker system. The two main components to the virtual acoustic showroom are simulating living environments using the image source method, and simulating speaker responses using inverse filtering. The image source method is used to simulate realistic living environments by filtering the environment impulse response by frequency-dependant absorption coefficients of typical building materials. Psychoacoustic tests show that listeners can match virtual acoustic cues with appropriate virtual visual cues. Inverse filtering is used to \"replace\" the frequency response function of one speaker with another, allowing a single set of speakers to represent any number of other speakers. Psychoacoustic tests show that listeners could not distinguish the difference between the original speaker and the reference speaker that was mimicking the original. The two components of this system are shown to be accurate both empirically and psychologically.

The data originated from a NIDA (National Institute on Drug Abuse) study designed to evaluate the effects of different treatment modalities in inpatient substance abuse treatment for women.  The study compared the drug profiles of women in four areasdrug of choice, frequency of use, problem severity, and level of psychological problems. The following groups were compared1) women who did not report abuse, 2) women who reported physical abuse only, 3) women who reported sexual abuse only, and 4) women who reported physical and sexual abuse.  The study did not find significant differences in either drug choice, problem severity, or frequency of drug use. In the area of psychological problems, the study did find a significant difference in interpersonal sensitivity between participants who reported a sexual abuse history vs. the other abuse groups. This finding suggests that women with a sexual abuse history are more mistrustful in their relationships with others, and this may suggest that group treatment will be more difficult for sexually abused women than individual treatment.  Overall, the findings may also suggest abused women do not need different drug or alcohol treatment approaches than non-abused women although it does not preclude attention to the effects of their abuse.

Instead, these additional transistors could be used to take advantage of thread level parallelism (TLP). This type of parallelism focuses on hundreds of instructions, rather than single instructions, executing in parallel. Additionally, as transistor sizes shrink, the wires on a chip become thinner. Fabricating a thinner wire means increasing the resistance and thus, the latency of that wire. In fact, in the near future, a signal may not reach a portion of the chip in a single clock cycle. So, in future designs, it will be important to limit the length of the wires on a chip. The SCMP parallel computer is a new architecture that is made up of small processing elements, called nodes, which are connected in a 2-D mesh with nearest neighbor connections. Nodes communicate with one another, via message passing, through a network, which uses dimension order worm-hole routing. To support TLP, each node is capable of supporting multiple threads, which execute in a non-preemptive round robin manner. The wire lengths of this system are limited since a node is only connected to its nearest neighbors. This paper focuses on the System C hardware design of the node that gets replicated across the chip. The result is a node implementation that can be used to create a hardware model of the SCMP parallel computer.

The prevalent model for such mechanisms is to take a snapshot of the state of an application, called a checkpoint and commit it to stable storage. This checkpoint has sufficient meta-data, so that if the application fails, it can be restarted from the checkpoint. This operation is called a restore. In order to record a process' complete state, both its volatile and persistent state must be checkpointed. Several libraries exist for checkpointing volatile state. Some of these libraries feature incremental checkpointing, where only the changes since the last checkpoint are recorded in the next checkpoint. Such incremental checkpointing is advantageous since otherwise, the time taken for each successive checkpoint becomes larger and larger. Also, when checkpointing is done in increments, we can restore state to any of the previous checkpoints; a vital feature for adaptive applications. This thesis presents a user-level incremental checkpointing library for filesMetamori. This brings the advantages of incremental memory checkpointing to files as well, thereby providing a low-overhead approach to checkpoint persistent state. Thus, the complete state of an application can now be incrementally checkpointed, as compared to earlier approaches where volatile state was checkpointed incrementally but persistent state had no such facilities.

Contamination can occur via the salt brines that are used to cool thermally processed meats. Both L. monocytogenes and lactic acid bacteria can grow and thrive under these brine conditions, and may become competitive with each other for available nutrients. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a three strain cocktail of lactic acid bacteria Enterococcus faecalis, Carnobacterium gallinarum, and Lactobacillus plantarum on the survival of Listeria monocytogenes and Listeria innocua in brines stored under low temperatures up to 10 days. Three brine concentrations (0%, 7.9%, and 13.2% NaCl) were inoculated with ~7.0 log10 cfu/ml of one of five cocktails (L. monocytogenes, L. innocua, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), L. monocytogenes + LAB, or L. innocua + LAB) and stored for 10 days at either 4°C or 12°C. Three replications of each brine/cocktail/temperature combination were performed. No reductions of L. monocytogenes were seen in 7.9 or 13.2% NaCl with LAB; however, reductions of L. monocytogenes were seen in the 0% NaCl with LAB (1.43 log at 4°C and 3.02 log at 12°C). Listeria innocua was significantly less resilient to environmental stresses than L. monocytogenes, both with and without LAB present (p<0.05). This research indicates these strains of lactic acid bacteria are not effective at reducing L. monocytogenes in brines at low temperatures. Furthermore, the use of L. innocua as a model for L. monocytogenes is not appropriate under these environmental conditions.

A typical multigrid implementation uses a base discretization method, such as finite elements or finite differences, and a set of successively coarser grids that is used for accelerating the convergence of the iterative solution on the base grid. The presented thesis extends the use of multigrid acceleration to the design optimization of a sample structural system and demonstrates it within the context of the recently introduced Cellular Automata paradigm for design optimization. Within the design context, the multigrid scheme is not only used for accelerating the analysis iterations, but is also used to help refine the design across multiple grid levels to accelerate the design convergence. A comparison of computational efficiencies achieved by different multigrid implementations, including the multigrid accelerated nested design iteration scheme, is presented. The method is described in its generic form which can be applicable not only to the Cellular Automata paradigm but also to more general finite element analysis based design schemes as well.

The state of Tennessee has implemented the Tennessee Rockfall Management System (RMS) as a means of reducing the liabilities associated with rockfall hazard. It utilizes digital data acquisition via PDAs coupled with distribution via an expandable web-based GIS database. The Tennessee Rockfall Hazard Rating System (RHRS) is part of the Tennessee RMS and assigns a numeric hazard rating according relative hazard for all slopes identified as having a high potential for delivering rock blocks onto Tennessee Department of Transportation maintained roadways. The Tennessee RHRS uses standard rock slope failure mechanisms (planar failure, wedge failure, topple failure, differential weathering, and raveling) along with the site and roadway geometry to assess the rockfall hazard of an individual slope. This study suggests methods that will expedite fieldwork, including an informational guide on how to properly identify individual failure mechanisms in the field. Also, the study examines the current method of scoring abundance and suggests an alternative, multiplicative approach. The alternative of using a multiplicative abundance is considered and its results summarized.

Economic weights (EW) were derived for estimated breeding values (BV) from National Sheep Improvement Program genetic evaluations for 120 d weaning weight (WW), maternal milk (MM), yearling weight (YW), fleece weight (FW), fiber diameter (FD), staple length (SL), and prolificacy (PLC; lambs born/100 ewes lambing). A commercial flock was simulated, accounting for nonlinear relationships between performance and profit. Ewes were assumed mated to sires of specified BV and profit was derived from lifetime performance of lambs and replacement females from that lamb crop. Economic weights were determined as change in profit from use of sires with BV that were one additive standard deviation above the mean for each trait [1.98 kg for WW, 1.62 kg for MM, 2.90 kg for YW, 0..36 kg for FW, 0.99 microns for FD, 0.74 cm for SL, and 17.58 lambs/100 ewes for LC], while holding all other BV at breed average. Separate breeding objectives were derived for different ways of meeting increased nutrient needs (P = purchase hay, R = rent pasture, and L= limited flock size) and for different market lamb values (D = discounting lamb value for heavy weights, ND = no discount for heavy lambs). Based on replicated simulations, relative EW did not vary with prolificacy or triplet survival (P > 0.15) but were affected by feed costs and lamb market values (P < 0.01). Selection indexes were derived within and across simulated scenarios, and correlation (r) among indexes of > 0.90 indicated that an index could be used across multiple scenarios with little loss of selection efficiency. Indexes derived within feed cost scenarios (P, R, and L) and lamb value scenarios (D, ND) were strongly intercorrelated (r > 0.97). Correlations among average indexes for feed cost scenarios (0.97 for R and P, 0.70 for R and L; 0.85 for P and L) indicated that two feed cost scenarios could be used depending on whether winter forage was limited (L) or not (NL). The correlation between average indexes for these two scenarios was 0.78. Indexes were presented for combinations of feed cost and lamb value scenarios. Two indexes were suggested, representing the scenarios that apply to a large portion of Targhee producers. These indexes were for discounting heavy lambs with limited winter forage (D-L1.0 WW + 0.14 MM __ 0.76 YW + 1.22 FW __ 0.36 FD - 0.09 SL + 0.25 LC) and discounting heavy lambs with additional available forage (D-NL1.0 WW + 0.24 MM __ 0.34 YW + 1.65 FW __ 0.41 FD - 0.14 SL + 0.33 LC). For a standardized selection differential of one for the index, the expected changes in mean index value were $2.17 and $1.92 per ewe per generation for D-L and D-NL, respectively.

The extracts were screened for cytotoxicity using the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell line bioassay. The crude extract of Casearia nigrescens was fractionated and yielded five known compounds and one new compound that were cytotoxic. Mass spectrometry and 1D and 2D NMR techniques were used to determine the structure of the isolated compounds.  The dichloromethane fraction of Casearia nigrescens was weakly active in the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell line bioassay. Further separation of the dichloromethane fraction resulted in the isolation of five known compounds (casearlucin A, caseamenbrol A, rel-18(S),19(R)-diacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-6(R)-hydroxy-2(S)-(2ξ-methylbutanoyloxy)-5(R),8(S),9(S),10(R)-cleroda-3,13(16),14-triene, casearlucin B, and rel-18(S),19(R)-diacetoxy- 18,19-epoxy-2(S)-(2ξ-ethylbutanoyloxy)-5(R),8(S),9(S),10(R)-cleroda-3,13(16),14-triene) and one new compound (casearlucin L). Based on the available literature this was the first investigation of the natural products of Casearia nigrescens. The structure of the known compounds was determined by comparison of the NMR, MS, optical rotation, UV, and IR data with the data found in the literature. The structure of casearlucin L was determined by NMR data and comparison with the NMR data for similar known compounds.

The testing of the framework was achieved through the use of two case studiesIndia and Pakistan. It becomes clear, after using the two case study countries to test the framework, that the framework is an excellent way to organize the collection of data toward the ends listed above, but that the framework has limitations pertaining to the ability to actually gather all of the data necessary to successfully fulfill its requirements. The complex nature of the framework made for an exhaustive search for data and information dealing with India and Pakistan but ultimately allowed for reasonable assessment of national power in the two countries, not in the sense of which one was definitively more or less powerful, but rather, in a way that allows for the assessment of areas of strength and weakness country that a country may have.

Familiarity with clothing allows sensors and computational elements to be naturally integrated into garments such that wearability and usability is preserved. The dynamics of the human body and the wide variety of sensor and processing choices render the typical prototype-based design methodology prohibitively difficult and expensive. Simulation of e-textile systems not only reduces these problems but allows for thorough exploration of the design space, faster design cycles, and more robust applications. Gait analysis, the measurement of various body motion parameters during walking for medical purposes, and context awareness, the recognition of user motions, are two immediate applications that e-textiles can impact and emphasize the feasibility of e-textiles as a medium for sensor deployment on the human body. This thesis presents the design of a simulation environment for wearable e-textile systems and demonstrates the use of the simulation via a prototype pair of e-textile pants.

This brine may be the result of phase-separation of seawater that occurred within the syn-impact sediments as underlying deformed and possibly melted basement rock cooled following impact. The 85 km wide crater has been described as a complex peak-ring crater; created 35.8 million years ago in the then submerged unconsolidated sediments of the Atlantic Coastal Plain and now completely buried by post-impact sediments. An annular trough with relatively undisturbed basement surrounds a ~38 km diameter inner basin with a peak ring and central uplift. The basement surface within the inner basin was modified by the impact and is projected to be approximately 1.6 km below sea level.  Geothermometry and advective and conductive heat flow modeling was performed to characterize a possible post-impact hydrothermal system. Thermal maturity and radiogenic techniques were used to estimate the temperature history of the crater sediments. Core samples from one borehole just outside the crater, two within the annular trough, and one shallow borehole within the inner basin were examined. Numerical heat and fluid flow models were developed using a range of likely sediment parameters and basal heat flow values to determine if phase-separation temperatures were likely to have occurred, and to evaluate what affect, if any, lithostatic overpressures may have had on post-impact cooling.  Geothermometry results indicate that no detectable thermal anomaly exists within the syn or post-impact sediments at these boreholes; however, no data are available within the deep inner basin where temperatures were likely to have been higher. Samples from existing boreholes suggest that sediment are organically immature and likely were never heated above ~40°C for a geologically significant period of time. These results support apatite He (U/Th) and previously published apatite fission track radiogenic ages indicating no Cenozoic resetting. Heat flow simulations indicate that a high temperature (>400°C) hydrothermal system could have existed within the inner basin and not caused any measurable effect on thermal maturity in the annular trough and shallow portion of the inner basin. Results also indicate that phase-separation could have occurred in the syn-impact sediments using reasonable estimates of basal heat flow, permeability, thermal conductivity, and porosity values, and that overpressures resulting from rapid deposition of syn-impact sediments dissipate within a few thousand years and are not an important heat transport mechanism.

These parts can have an autonomous existence separately and combine to formulate a different event collectively.  This thesis is a study of how a building accommodates to the changing needs of a diverse community. It does this by investigating to what end two neighboring apartments, one small and one medium-sized could combine to develop into one large apartment, and revert back again to two apartments when the needs of the inhabitants change. This concept could be paralleled to Jazz, where the musicians find means of altering the sound of the music through improvisation between the notes of the song. The structure of the building like the notes of the melody provides the stationary component and forms the rhythmic beat between the apartments. The pauses or gaps between the structure provide the opportunity for flexibility and improvisation. The melody of the construction comes from the integration of the repetitious permanent structural elements, semipermanent conditions and spontaneously alterable parts. The orchestration of these components allows the building to transform and experience an altering production of its own.

Maps allow designers to record and filter impossibly complex information about an environment. Designers try to capture a variety of aspects of a site through the use of graphic tools like maps and drawings. While there is a long-established conventional graphic language for recording characteristics of a site, this language is often inadequate when one attempts to explore and capture subtler perceptual qualities of urban environments. Many of these perceptual qualities can greatly inform a design and some designers have invented creative mapping strategies to record and analyze difficult aspects of a site. This position paper follows the work of innovative designers who creatively map perceptual qualities of urban landscapes. The theories and practices of these designers have informed my development of new creative tools for mapping my perception of space.  The design portion of this thesis takes place in the Mexican War Streets Neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and results in a plaza for the local Mattress Factory Art Museum. The design phase uses and evaluates traditional perception and representational tools of urban design. New creative maps are used to express what the traditional tools cannot.

The purpose of this research was to examine cultural differences associated with risk communication and risk perception. The research observed cultural differences in hazard perception associated with color, signal words, and symbols among industry workers from the United States of America and the Republic of Ghana. The research also examined the perception of risk associated with general everyday statements as well as locus of control. A total of 96 industry workers from both the USA and the Republic of Ghana participated in this study (USA = 46, Ghana = 50). Four different hypotheses were tested in this research. The hypotheses that were tested focused on risk perception (21 items) and locus of control (9 items), hazard perception and attention-getting for 6 symbols (carefulness, severity of injury implied, and understanding were also measured for the symbols) and 16 hazard signs. A pair wise comparison was used in one portion of the study in which 120 different signal word and color combination hazard signs were used. A nine-point Likert-type scale was used to evaluate the risk perception items. A four point Likert-type scale was used to measure locus of control.  The results from the study concluded that there are significant differences between the two cultures and the way individuals perceive risk, perceive hazards associated symbols, evaluate hazard signs, and locus of control. A total risk perception score as well as individual risk perception scores were calculated for the 21 items using an independent sample t-test. The results for the total risk perception revealed significant differences between the two groups (t (84) = 6.43, p < .0001) with the participants from the USA having an overall higher risk perception with the mean equaling 6.39 and the participants from Ghana equaling 5.28.  Significant findings such as those from the risk perception portion of this study as well as other significant findings in this study will contribute to suggested guidelines and implications for safety training in a global work environment. Such guidelines and implications include using the SKULL symbol instead of the MR YUCK symbol to communicate hazard in Ghana and suggesting that the BOLT and ELECTRIC SHOCK symbol can be used interchangeably.

One way for students to cultivate this sense of belonging is by participating in formal and informal peer groups (Chickering & Reisser, 1993). Of all peer groups, Greek-lettered organizations, when serving as an effective peer group, have the most impact on its members (Chickering & Reisser, 1993).  As Greek-lettered organizations evolved, pledge processes were created as a means of promoting group values and continuing traditions (Nuwer, 1999). However, this pledge process led to accidents and deaths (Kimbrough, 2003; Nuwer; 1999; Ruffins, 1999). As a result, Black Greek-lettered organizations (BGLOs) replaced their pledge process with a membership intake process (Kimbrough, 1997, 2003; Ruffins, 1999). Despite the end of pledging, BGLO members instituted 'underground pledging,' unsanctioned events that occurred before, during, and/or after the membership intake process as a way to continue the pledge process (Kimbrough, 2003). As a result, students still perceive the pledge process as an instrumental part of the Black Greek experience and continue to participate in unsanctioned pledge activities that lead to injuries and deaths (Geraghty, 1997; Jones, 2000; Morgan, 1998; Rodriguez, 1995; Ruffins, 1997; 2001).  Very little research has been conducted on BGLOs. As such, it would seem that research is needed on how members experience and view the intake process. The present study attempted to address this gap by examining the activities that were associated with the membership intake process, as well as current undergraduate members' perceptions of the pledge and membership intake processes.

Any change in the implementation of one of the components affects the design of other components and, in turn, the performance of the system. This has led to an integrated design approach known as hardware/software co-design and co-verification.  The conventional techniques for co-design favor partitioning the system into hardware and software components at an early stage of the design and then iteratively refining it until a good solution is found. This method is expensive and time consuming. A more modern approach is to model the whole system and rigorously test and refine it before the partitioning is done. The key to this method is the ability to model and simulate the entire system. The advent of new System Level Modeling Languages (SLML), like SystemC, has made this possible.  This research proposes a strategy to automate the process of partitioning a system model after it has been simulated and verified. The partitioning idea is based on systems modeled using Process Model Graphs (PmG). It is possible to extract a PmG directly from a SLML like SystemC. The PmG is then annotated with additional attributes like IO delay and rate of activation. A complexity heuristic is generated from this information, which is then used by a greedy algorithm to partition the graph into different architectures.  Further, a command line tool has been developed that can process textually represented PmGs and partition them based on this approach.

The strains and deflections in the span reinforced with GFRP in the top mat were recorded under a series of truck crossings, and these were compared to the span reinforced with all steel bars under identical loading conditions, as well as design values and other test results. Transverse strains in the GFRP bars, girder distribution factors, girder bottom flange strains, dynamic load allowances, and weigh-in-motion gauge results were examined. From the live load tests, it was concluded that the bridge was designed conservatively for service loads, with measured strains, stresses, distribution factors, and impact factors below allowables and design values. The second objective was to monitor the construction of the bridge deck. To carry out this objective, researchers from Virginia Tech were on site during the bridge deck phase of the construction. The construction crews were observed while installing both the all-steel end span and the steel bottom/GFRP top end span. The installation of the GFRP bars went smoothly when compared to that of the steel bars. The workers were unfamiliar with the material at first, but by the end of the day were handling, installing, and tying the GFRP bars with skill. It was concluded that GFRP bars are an acceptable material in bridge deck applications with respect to constructibility issues. The third objective was to set up the long term monitoring and data collection of the bridge deck. Electrical resistance strain gauges, vibrating wire strain gauges, and thermocouples were installed in the deck prior to concrete casting to provide strain and temperature readings throughout the service life of the bridge. It was concluded that the span reinforced with GFRP was instrumented sufficiently for long-term health monitoring.

In the United States, however, each state has its own standard-issue plates, plus several optional styles, which are referred to as special license plates or varieties. There is a clear absence of standardization and multi-colored, complex backgrounds are becoming more frequent in license plates. Commercially available optical character recognition (OCR) systems generally fail when confronted with textured or poorly contrasted backgrounds, therefore creating the need for proper image segmentation prior to classification. The image segmentation problem in LPR is examined in two stageslicense plate region detection and license plate character extraction from background. Three different approaches for license plate detection in a scene are presentedregion distance from eigenspace, border location by edge detection and the Hough transform, and text detection by spectral analysis. The experiments for character segmentation involve the RGB, HSV/HSI and 1976 CIE L*a*b* color spaces as well as their Karhunen-Loéve transforms. The segmentation techniques applied include multivariate hierarchical agglomerative clustering and minimum-variance color quantization. The trade-off between accuracy and computational expense is used to select a final reliable algorithm for license plate detection and character segmentation. The spectral analysis approach together with the K-L L*a*b* transformed color quantization are found experimentally as the best alternatives for the two identified image segmentation stages for US license plate recognition.

The purposes of this study were to evaluate three of these survey tools for use in a younger population, and to determine if young adults with osteoporosis risk factors received bone health education from a health professional. Forty-two men and 41 women completed surveys and health questionnaires; responses were compared to bone mineral density (BMD) and content (BMC) measurements. Healthcare professionals discussed bone health with only 13% of participants. Chi-square analysis revealed that health professionals were not more likely to discuss osteoporosis with subjects based on age or gender. Participants with T-scores ≤ -1.0 were not more likely to receive bone health education. Area under the receiving operating characteristic (AUROC) curves analysis revealed that no survey tools were able to identify moderate-risk participants at T-scores ≤ -1.0, and AUROC curves for all surveys did not exceed 0.525 at this level. Two surveys detected participants at high risk for bone disease with identical AUROC curves of 0.821 at a T-score ≤ -2.0, and 0.813 at a T-score ≤ -2.5.

Beef cows (n = 796) and heifers (n = 108) at three locations were assigned randomly within age to one of four groups in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments with injection of FM (500 mg i.m.; Phoenix Scientific, St. Joseph, MO) 2 to 12 min prior to ET and insertion of a CIDR (1.38 g progesterone; Pfizer, New York, NY) for 13 d immediately following ET as main effects. Fresh or frozen embryos (Stage = 4 or 5; Grade = 1 or 2) were randomly assigned to be transferred to recipients on d 6 to 9 of the estrous cycle. At Location 2 a subset of fresh embryos were split and transferred as fresh half embryos (n = 192). Recipients at Location 2 only (n = 493) were observed for signs of return to estrus beginning 9 d after ET. Recipients that returned to estrus at Location 2 were either bred by AI 12 h after estrus or received an embryo 7 d after estrus. Pregnancy was diagnosed by ultrasonography. Pregnancy rates were analyzed using the LOGISTIC procedure of SAS. Pregnancy rates of split embryo recipients were analyzed separately using the same statistical procedure. Variation in the timing of the return to estrus was determined by an F-test for heterogeneity of variances. Following the initial ET, pregnancy rates of recipients receiving whole embryos were not affected by CIDR administration (P > 0.05; 65% with CIDR, 70% without CIDR), however, there was a significant FM x location interaction on PR (Location 1, 89 vs. 57%; Location 2, 69 vs. 64%; Location 3, 64 vs. 67% for FM vs. no FM, respectively). There was a significant CIDR x FM interaction on PR of recipients receiving split embryos. Pregnancy rates of split embryo recipients receiving CIDR treatment (54%) or FM treatment alone (41%) were less than controls (64%). However, recipients receiving both CIDR and FM had PR similar to controls (60%). The timing of the return to estrus was more synchronous (P < 0.01) for recipients fitted with a CIDR, but PR of recipients bred following a return to estrus did not differ in cows receiving or not receiving a CIDR (P > 0.13; 68 and 62%, respectively). Effects of FM on PR were location dependent and CIDR insertion at ET improved synchrony of the return to estrus.

It is ideally situated to record the changes in geomorphic process rates that occur in the Appalachians as a response to late Cenozoic climate variations. Active erosion features on resistant bedrock that floors the river at prominent knickpoints demonstrate that the river is currently incising toward base level. However, large packages of alluvial fill and fluvial terraces cut into this fill record an incision history for the river that includes several periods of stalled downcutting and aggradation. Cosmogenic 10-Be exposure dating, aided by mapping and sedimentological examination of terrace deposits, is used to constrain the timing of events in this history. Fill-cut and strath terraces at elevations 10, 20, and 50 m above the modern river yield cosmogenic exposure ages of approximately 130, 610, and 955 ka, respectively, but uncertainties on these ages are not well-constrained. This translates to a long-term average incision rate of 43 m/my, which is comparable to rates measured elsewhere in the Appalachians. During specific intervals over the last 1 Ma, however, the New River's incision rate reached 97 m/my. Fluctuations between aggradation and rapid incision appear to be related to late Cenozoic climate variations, though uncertainties in modeled ages preclude direct correlation of these fluctuations to specific climate change events. Erosion rates on higher alluvial deposits adjacent to the river are estimated from 10-Be concentrations; these rates are very low, about 2 m/my or less. This demonstrates a disequilibrium in the modern landscape, with river incision greatly outpacing erosion from nearby landforms.

However, the best methods are not fully understood yet. This thesis examines the areas of scenario-based design, claims relationships, and learning through cases with the goal of learning what can be improved to better support these processes.  In investigating those areas, an information visualization tool is created for learning design through case studies. The tool combined claims from multiple visualization techniques to create an approach for supporting problem-based learning goals. In creating the tool, scenario-based design was used, with a particular emphasis on claims for driving the development and evaluation. All design rationale was captured in claims to create a tool that addressed the current problem issues identified. A recently developed claims relationship framework, used for the first time in development efforts, aided in structuring the design rationale. Using these relationships, the design was tracked from requirements analysis to problem claims to design claims and finally to claims that formed the basis of an evaluation.  This thesis presents a case study of using claims relationships to drive the development and evaluation of a tool for supporting problem-based learning through case studies of scenario-based design. In creating a novel tool for learning about cases, a unique example of claims-centric scenario based design emerges, presenting as open questions new directions for merging scenarios, claims, and cases in knowledge storage, access, and learning systems.

In this thesis, we focus on performance evaluation of this approach in context of the amount of service received by certain nodes called policy execution points (PEPs) or policy clients from certain specialized nodes called the policy decision points (PDPs) or policy servers. We develop analytical models for the study of the system behavior under two scenarios; a simple Markovian scenario where we assume that the random variables associated with system processes follow an exponential distribution and a more complex non-Markovian scenario where we model the system processes according to general distribution functions as observed through simulation. We illustrate that the simplified Markovian model provides a reasonable indication of the trend of the service availability seen by policy clients and highlight the need for an exact analysis of the system without relying on Poisson assumptions for system processes. In the case of the more exact non-Markovian analysis, we show that our model gives a close approximation to the values obtained via empirical methods. Stochastic Petri Nets are used as performance evaluation tools in development and analysis of these system models.

The motivation for this thesis comes from the lack of previous work that has studied the effects of differences between the HMD and the CAVE on 3D interaction tasks. We conducted three user studies to determine how the differences between these two displays affect selection and manipulation in a 3D environment. Our first study demonstrates that 3D selection and manipulation tasks can be affected by the display type. Our second user study shows that task performance can suffer when a selection and manipulation technique is migrated to a display for which it is not intended. The third user study we conducted suggests that we can modify a selection and manipulation technique and improve its usability in the display to which it is migrated. We conclude with a set of guidelines to ease the migration of selection and manipulation techniques from the HMD to the CAVE while trying to maintain usability.

This motion is coupled because orbital control is dependent on the spacecraft attitude for vectored thrust. Formation flying spacecraft have a limited mass and volume for propulsion systems. We want to maximize the efficiency of the spacecraft, which leads to minimizing the error introduced by thrusting in the wrong direction. This thrust direction error leads to the need for a coupled attitude and orbital control strategy. In this thesis a coupled control system is developed using a nonlinear Lyapunov attitude controller and a nonlinear Lyapunov-based orbital controller. A nonlinear Lyapunov attitude controller is presented for a spacecraft with three-axis momentum wheel control. The nonlinear Lyapunov-based orbital controller is combined with a mean motion control strategy to provide a globally asymptotically stable controller. The attitude and orbit control laws are verified separately using numerical simulation, and then are integrated into a coupled control strategy. The coupled system simulations verify that the coupled control strategy is able to correct for an initial relative position error between two spacecraft.

A series of experiments was performed to determine the corrosion resistance of single crystal sapphire and single crystal fully stabilized cubic zirconia at high temperatures in coal slag and soda lime glass. The amount of corrosion of sapphire and zirconia in corrosive slags was measured at 1200°C, 1300°C, and 1400°C for different exposure times. The microstructural features at the interface of sapphire and zirconia were investigated using SEM and EDX analysis. The experimental measurements as well as SEM micrographs show very little or no degradation of sapphire and zirconia samples in corrosive slags. An interesting phenomenon was observed in the EDX scans of sapphire in the coal slagthe iron from the slag appears to have completely separated from the silicon and deposited at the sapphire surface. This interesting observation can be further explored to study whether this iron layer can be used to control the corrosion of sapphire.

Experimental addition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has been shown to inhibit rates of nitrification, and rates have been stimulated by NH4-N addition. Insights regarding the role of particulate organic matter (POM) in this scenario could further enhance our understanding of linkages between ecosystem carbon (C) and N cycles. Hugh White Creek, a headwater stream located in the southern Appalachian mountains of North Carolina, USA, receives large amounts of allochthonous POM inputs each fall. To address the effects of these inputs on nitrification, I conducted a seasonal survey of organic matter standing stocks and nitrification rates along with experimental manipulation of dissolved C and N supplies in stream sediment microcosms to determine1) how rates of nitrification compare across seasons, and 2) to what extent nitrification rates are influenced by seasonal changes in standing stocks and relative abundances of both sedimentary and dissolved forms of C and N. Rates of nitrification were most closely and positively related to rates of ammonification, which, in turn were negatively related to C:N of fine benthic organic matter (FBOM). Uniform additions of C and N throughout the year had different effects on rates of nitrification and ammonification due to their changing relative importance as sediment organic matter stocks were depleted and underwent changes in quality. Slow rates of nitrification for much of the year could be attributed to large quantities of C relative to N in stream sediments. To the extent that changes in OM stocks dictate change in C and N availability, seasonal patterns in OM dynamics represent changes in ecosystem structure relevant to rates of nitrification, emphasizing the importance of terrestrial/aquatic linkages for predicting rates of N transformation in aquatic ecosystems.

The aim of the thesis is to provide the parameters needed in order to develop a channel model for such cases. The channel model would then play an important role in determining physical layer (PHY) solutions to optimally exploit these characteristics.  The measurements carried out on the Virginia Tech campus are used to compute parameters such as path loss, penetration loss and delay statistics. These are carried out in multiple frequency bands and the results are compared across frequency bands to determine effect of different frequency levels on the parameters.  Finally the results are analyzed with respect to similar parameters obtained in other measurement campaigns in an attempt to evaluate the performance of Ultrawideband vis-à-vis narrowband systems.

Many software companies forego the usability engineering aspect of their projects due to the time required to design and test user interfaces. Unfortunately, there is no \"silver bullet\" for user interface design and implementation because they are inherently difficult tasks. As computers are moving off the desktop, the greatest challenge for designers will be integrating these systems seamlessly into our everyday lives. The potential for reuse in user interfaces lies in reducing the time and effort required for this task, without sacrificing design quality. In this work we begin with an iterative development cycle for a claims library based on prominent literature within the HCI and software engineering fields. We constructed the Claims Library to be a repository of potentially reusable notification system claims. We examine the library through theoretical and practical perspectives. The theoretical perspective reveals tradeoffs in the initial implementation that relate to Krueger's taxonomy of reuse. The practical perspective stems from experience in designing and conducting usability testing for an in-vehicle input device using the Claims Library. While valuable, these examinations did not provide a distinct method of improving the library. Expecting to uncover a specific diagnosis for the problems in the library, it was unclear how they should be approached with further development efforts. With this realization, we saw that a more important and immediate contribution would not be another iteration of the Claims Library design. Rather, a clarification of the underlying theory that would better inform future systems development seemed a more urgent and worthy use of our experience. This clarification would need to have several characteristics to includecomposed of a staged or prioritized architecture, represents an ideal model grounded in literature, and possesses intermediate development objectives and assessment points. As a solution, we propose the Claims Library Capability Maturity Model (CL-CMM), based on the theoretical deficiencies that should guide development of a claims library, as noted in the two evaluations. This thesis delivers a five-stage model to include process areas, goals, and practices that address larger threads of concern. Our capability maturity model is patterned after models in software engineering and human resource management. We include a full description of each stage, a gap analysis method of appraisal, and an example of its use. Several directions for future work are noted that are necessary to continue development and validation of the model.

The three bumps examined are named bump 1, small bump 3, and large bump 3, and are the same test cases studied by Byun et al. (2004) and Ma and Simpson (2004) with a LDV system and a quad-wire hot-wire probe, respectively. Various experimental methods are used in this workFor measuring the mean velocity component in the planes examined, a seven-hole pressure probe is used with the data reduction algorithm developed by Johansen et al. (2001). A sixteen-hole pressure rake is used for boundary layer data on the sidewalls and ceiling of the test section and a Pitot-static probe is used to obtain mean velocity magnitude in the centerline of the test section. Specific techniques are developed to minimize the uncertainties due to the apparatus used, and an uncertainty analysis is used to confirm the efficiency of these techniques.  Measurements in the wake of bump 1 reveal a strong streamwise vorticity creating large amounts of high moment fluid entrained close to the wall. In the wake of small bump 3, the amount of high momentum fluid entrained close to the wall is small as well as the streamwise vorticity. The flow in the wake of large bump 3 incorporate the characteristics of the two previous bumps by having a relatively large entrainment of high momentum fluid close to the wall and a low generation of streamwise vorticity. In the wakes of the three bumps, a pair of counter rotating vortices is created. The influence of large bump 3 on the incoming flow-field is found to be significant and induces an increase of the boundary layer thickness.  By comparing LDV data and quad-wire hot-wire data with seven-hole probe data in the wakes of the bumps at the same locations, it is shown that uncertainties defined for a quasi-steady, non-turbulent flow-field without velocity gradient are bad indicators of the magnitude of the uncertainties in a more complex flow-field. A theoretical framework is discussed to understand the effects of the velocity gradient and of turbulence on the pressures measured by the seven-hole probe. In this fashion, a model is proposed and validated to explain these effects. It is observed that the main contribution to the uncertainties in seven-hole probe measurements due to the velocity gradient and to the turbulence comes from the velocity gradient. To correct for the effects of the velocity gradient on seven-hole probe measurements in an unknown flow-field, a technique is proposed. Using an estimation of the velocity gradient calculated from the seven-hole probe, the proposed model could be used to re-evaluate non-dimensional pressure coefficients used in the data reduction algorithm therefore correcting for the effects of the velocity gradient on seven-hole probe measurements.

This disease causes reduction in the yield and quality of soybean crop. Three independent genes Rsv1, Rsv3, and Rsv4, were found to provide host resistance in soybean. Rsv1 confers resistance to all but most virulant strains of SMV. Rsv1 has been mapped to soybean molecular linkage group (MLG) F by using molecular markers.  The purpose of this study is to investigate the location of Rsv3 gene on soybean map using molecular markers. The Rsv3 gene of soybean confers resistance to the most vurulent strains (G5-G7) of SMV. In order to map the gene, an F2 population was constructed from a cross between L29, an Rsv3 isoline of 'Williams', and 'Lee 68', a susceptible cultivar. Rsv3 genotypes of 183 F2 plants were determined by inoculating F2:3 progeny with the G7 strain of SMV.  A preliminary survey of two parental lines, near isogenic lines (NILs), and bulk segregants with 136 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers yielded 36 markers showing variation between the two parents. These polymorphic RFLP markers unable to provided any indication of linkage to Rsv3.  As an alternative strategy, amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) marker analysis of the two parental lines, NILs and bulk segregants was performed using 64 primer combinations. Initial breakthrough came in the form of AFLP primer combination of Eco+AAC/Mse+CTG exhibited polymorphism between NILs, bulk segregants, and two parental lines. This AFLP marker was isolated and cloned to convert it into a RFLP clone to further investigate the linkage to Rsv3 by F2 segregation analysis.  A mapping population constructed by crossing Glycine max x Glycine soja employed in determining the location AFLP-derived RFLP clone on soybean linkage map. This population has densely mapped molecular marker data that enabled determining the location of AFLP-derived RFLP clone ACR1 on soybean molecular linkage group (MLG) B2 between the markers pA516 and pA519.  This finding, made it easy to establish the linkage of markers pA519, pA516, and pA593 in L29 x Lee 68 population by F2 segregation analysis. The closest marker linked pA519, was 0.9 cM away from Rsv3. In another study Rsv4 is reported to be mapped to MLG D1b of soybean.  Results of this study are useful in marker-based selection (MAS), pyramiding viral resistance genes and in cloning the Rsv3 gene.

Operator-treated respiratory disease occurrences within the first year of life and digestive disease occurrences within the first 45 d of life were analyzed to determine their effects on calfhood morbidity, age at first calving, 305-d first lactation production, and mortality in first lactation. Of the 2556 records used, 2083 calves contracted respiratory or digestive disease at least once, 1254 calves had digestive disease only, 771 had respiratory disease only, and 191 calves had both diseases. Occurrence of calfhood digestive disease increased the chance of calfhood respiratory disease 2-fold. Age at first calving increased 0.53 mo with multiple occurrences of respiratory disease versus none. Calves born in the winter calved at 25.4 mo, whereas calves born in spring calved at 24.5 mo. Respiratory disease had the largest effect on calves born in the spring, resulting in 23.9 mo age at first calving for no occurrence and 25.4 mo for multiple occurrences. No significant effect of disease was detected for 305-d milk yield, fat yield, or SCC, but protein yield decreased by 0.05 kg/d with increased calf respiratory disease. Although calfhood disease had no influence on illness as a cow, disease-free calves had a 5% advantage in probability of remaining in the herd through 305-d, and an 8% advantage at 730-d compared with calves with 2 or more disease occurrences. In conclusion, calfhood occurrences of respiratory and digestive disease had a slight impact on age at first calving, depending on season of birth, and minimal impact on production performance through 305-d of first lactation. The occurrence of respiratory or digestive disease caused a decrease in survival rate from calving through 305-d in first lactation and 730 d after calving.

Knowledge of the volume, distribution, and use of CWD across Virginia would be useful to forest managers modeling nutrient budgets in southeastern forests and is important to wildlife management efforts. Knowledge of the effectiveness of informational brochures and cooperative learning activities/presentations at influencing public perception of CWD is important to program design and evaluation efforts in teaching and extension. The objectives of this study were to quantify the relationship between forest cover type and CWD volume, correlate CWD volume with small mammal and bird activity, distribute information on the advantages and disadvantages of CWD using informational brochures and cooperative learning activities/presentations, and compare the effectiveness of such teaching techniques at influencing public perception of CWD. The volume and wildlife use of CWD was assessed within 12 mature second-growth stands in Virginia. Volume of CWD was measured using fixed-area plots. Use of CWD by small mammals and birds was assessed by noting bodily, foraging, or movement evidence. Pre- and post-survey instruments were used to evaluate how perceptions were altered in first year college students who either reviewed an informational brochure or participated in a cooperative learning activity/presentation. Results suggested that the management of CWD for wildlife was most needed in southeastern Virginia where CWD volumes were lowest and that the value of CWD for wildlife was best conveyed through cooperative learning activities/presentations and may be important to landowner education efforts. Results suggested that management efforts to increase CWD volumes in Virginia should focus on coniferous dominated stands where CWD volumes were lowest. Such a finding, combined with the knowledge that the value of CWD was best conveyed through presentations, suggests that landowners of coniferous woodlots could be effectively educated with presentations. Given that brochures were more effective for females than males, brochures addressing natural resource issues might be the most appropriate, cost effective method of education at events that target female audiences. Knowledge gained from this study that CWD management for wildlife would be most appropriate in western Virginia where CWD was most used by wildlife for travel and that presentations were most effective at reaching suburban participants may be important to outreach program design efforts. Regardless of academic major, presentations were more effective at generating positive attitudes toward CWD. The results of this study suggest that the choice between informational brochures and presentations for influencing public perceptions of CWD will likely be influenced by the demographics of the target audience and the relevance of the topic locally.

Conformable, durable and, when equipped with interdigitated electrodes (IDEs), more responsive than regular monolithic devices, PFCs promise to revolutionize the application of piezoelectric materials. Developed by the NASA-Langley Research Center, the Macro-Fiber Composite (MFC) actuator and sensor is the most sophisticated PFC device yet invented. With superior qualities among PFCs in performance, behavior repeatability and manufacturability, the MFC has spawned great interest in the commercial and academic community as a tool in multitudinous engineering applications. While the MFC's characteristics render it a singularly useful device, limited characterization and modeling research on the MFC exists. Empirically designed and assembled, the MFC is poorly understood, especially in terms of its underlying operating principles, its dependence on design parameters and its electrical properties. The majority of published MFC studies focus on experimental quantification of MFC mechanical and actuation properties, and the research that attempts to model the MFC relies totally on finite element analysis. Published works widely assume that analytical models of the MFC are totally impossible. Rectifying gaps in the current body of MFC research, this study presents the first accurate analytical model of the static electrical field properties of the MFC. Implementing the techniques of conformal mapping, a branch of complex analysis, the following chapters derive a closed-form, exact analytical solution describing the electrical potential field and electrical field of the MFC's dual-IDE structure. Based on the conformal mapping solution for the MFC's electrical field, the electrical field of the commercially available MFC is examined and analyzed, introducing an intuitive knowledge of the MFC's operation. Demonstrating the utility of this solution in modeling the MFC, this work also predicts the capacitance and induced strain properties of a continuum of potential MFC designs and offers final suggestions on improving the current commercial MFC design. After establishing the theoretical underpinnings of the analytical MFC model, this report derives the conformal mapping solutions for the MFC, discusses the computational application of the resulting equations and then presents the results of numerical analyses executed using the new analytical model.

This study examines the geography of international education programs associated with US research institutions and shows that world cities emerge as popular places for US institutions to interact with other universities. The paper contributes to both educational and globalization literature by examining on a macro-scale the internationalization programs associated with US research institutions.  This research shows that Paris, Tokyo, Seoul, London, and Melbourne emerge as the top five locations for US abroad activities among the universities studied. While in many instances US abroad programs displayed characteristics that allowed students and researchers the opportunity to gain exposure to another language and culture, some abroad programs expanded the opportunities for participants by including the opportunity to work and interact with international firms and pursue degrees (international business, masters of economics, and international law) that make individuals competitive in the global employment market. Finally, this research shows that many US universities locate abroad programs in world cities. Although no clear reason or relationship for this phenomenon emerged during the course of this research, it illustrates and area for potential further study in a variety of fields.

The community, as understood by pragmatists, is not merely a collection of individuals, though this is certainly part of the story. Rather, 'community' refers to a much more refined philosophical notion. The community is a framework of rules and standards for proper inference, judgments, and conduct that are determined by inquirers who share membership in a group. In turning to the community, pragmatists reject the methodological individualism of epistemological models produced under the influence of Descartes, and maintain that knowledge can only be secured in an intersubjective context within which substantive discussion and criticism are promoted and conducted. Pragmatists such as Charles S. Peirce, John Dewey, and Wilfrid Sellars and contemporary descendents of pragmatism like Wilfrid Sellars embraced the notion of community and developed the crucial role it plays in evaluating knowledge claims. The aim of this thesis is two-fold. I examine critically the role the community plays in pragmatic epistemology by looking closely at the philosophies of Charles S. Peirce and Wilfrid Sellars. Additionally, I examine whether the turn to community enables pragmatists to respond to philosophical problems that have been hitherto unanswerable by models of knowledge that restrict their focus to the individual. Specifically, I look closely at the problem of solipsism and examine whether pragmatists have the resources for responding to this problem successfully. It is my hope that by undertaking this project we will obtain a clearer picture of pragmatic epistemology and some of the strengths in following pragmatists in making the turn to community.

As of 2003, there are 13 cameras in operation. The camera takes 2 pictures of a vehicle while it illegally entered the intersection and after it entered the intersection. These photographs give evidence of the red light violation. The citation is mailed to the register owner of the vehicle. The penalty is $50. This study has been conducted to evaluate the program. The violation and accident data at all of the study intersections were provided by Fairfax County Department of Transportation and Fairfax County Police Department. The traffic data in Fairfax County were provided by Virginia Department of Transportation. The results of the violation analysis indicate that the Red Light Camera program did reduce the violation rate by up to 58 percent in the 22nd ' 27th month period of the operation. The study also shows that the increase of the amber-time interval produced a higher reduction in violation rate up to 70 percent. The reduction in violation was found to be statistically significant. The violation rate is reduced to 1-2 violations per 10,000 vehicles considering the effect of the RLC operation only. With the effect of both RLC and amber-time increase, the violation rate is reduced to 0-1 violation per 10,000 vehicles. The accident rate is reduced by 27 percent after 2 years of the RLC operation. The Red Light Camera is found to have an effect on the reduction in Property Damage Only accident. However, the reduction in accident was not found to be statistically significant. Therefore, there is no benefit accrued from the reduction in accidents. From this study, the Red Light Camera program increases safety at camera intersections in Fairfax County by reducing violation rates after 2 years of its operation.

In this context, other scholars, including Chris Atton, John Downing, Stephen Duncombe, Nina Eliasoph, and Clemencia Rodriguez, have argued for the importance of citizens' media, defined as citizen-run, non-profit, independent media projects that may have greater democratic potential. Since the majority of research into citizens' media has focused on media from urban cities, this thesis offers discussion and analysis of a progressive citizen'­s paper, the New River Free Press, located in a rural, Appalachian community that is home to a large technical, military, state university. After first reviewing major scholarly criticism of mainstream media in a democratic society and characteristics and debates about citizen'­s media, this thesis uses interviews of key staff members and textual analysis of archived past issues of the New River Free Press to situate the paper in the citizen'­s media literature. Ultimately, this thesis locates citizens' media as a necessity for democratic societies, suggesting methods of resistance against undemocratic practice and the further consolidation and monopolization of the global media system.

Technology scaling increases the effects of wire latencies, inductive effects, noise and crosstalk in on-chip communication, limiting the performance of DSM designs. Power efficient performance gains from Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) are reaching a limit. Single-Chip Parallel Computers are promising solutions to the DSM design challenges and the performance limitations of ILP. These systems are explicitly modular architectures that efficiently support Thread Level Parallelism (TLP) while avoiding global signals and shared resources.  Microarchitectural level power analysis is required for evaluating the feasibility of newly conceived architectures in terms of power dissipation and energy efficiency. Accounting for power in the early stages of design shortens the time-to-market due to reduced design iteration times. Power optimizations at the architectural level can yield large power savings. This thesis proposes a microarchitectural level power estimation and analysis infrastructure for Single Chip Parallel Computers. The power estimation tool and the analysis methodology are developed based on the Single Chip Message-Passing Parallel (SCMP) Computer and can be extended to other Single Chip Parallel Computers.

There is strong evidence for a relationship between physical risk factors, such as repetitive motions and excessive force, and the development of WMSDs; yet there are unexplained discrepancies in determining which workers are more at risk. Researchers hypothesize that non-physical factors in the workplace, or psychosocial factors, may contribute to the development of WMSDs. The following study examined the effects of two psychosocial factors, mental workload and time pressure, on perceived workload and physiological reactions of the lower arm and wrist during typing activity by measuring muscle activation patterns, wrist posture and movement, key strike forces, and subjective assessments of overall workload. The results indicate that increases in time pressure lead to increases in lower arm muscle activation, key strike forces, and wrist deviations. Key strike forces may increase with higher mental workload levels, but other effects of mental workload were not clear. Perceived overall workload (time load, mental effort load, and stress load) increased with mental workload and time pressure, and typing performance decreased. The evidence from this study suggests that these psychosocial factors (mental workload and time pressure) mediate physical risk factors to increase risk for WMSD development in the upper extremities. The results illustrate the need for those designing jobs and work tasks to consider both physical and psychosocial aspects of the working environment to prevent injuries in employees.

In the vicinity of bifurcations flow tends to separate forming re-circulation regions. In addition, due to the pulsatile character of blood flow during the deceleration part of the cycle, the flow becomes unstable and transition to turbulence may occur. Vascular stents provide a novel method in treatment of atherosclerotic vessels. Although stents have dramatically decreased the re-stenosis rate of vessels compared to balloon-angioplasty, restenosis still occurs in 25-30% of coronary implanted stents. Understanding how stents influence flow patterns may lead to more hemodynamically compatible stent designs that alleviate thrombus formation and promote endothelialization.  The first study employed time-resolved Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) to compare the hemodynamic performance of two stents in a compliant vessel. The first stent was a rigid insert, representing an extreme compliance mismatch. The second stent was a commercially available nitinol stent with some flexural characteristics. DPIV showed that compliance mismatch promotes the formation of a ring vortex in the vicinity of the stent. Larger compliance mismatch increased both the size and residence time of the ring vortex, and introduced in-flow stagnation points. These results provide detailed quantitative evidence of the hemodynamic effect of stent mechanical properties. Better understanding of these characteristics will provide valuable information for modifying stent design in order to promote long-term  In the second study, DPIV was utilized to explore the fluid dynamics phenomena in a symmetric compliant bifurcation. We studied the effects of the Womersley and the Reynolds numbers under pulsatile flow conditions. New insight of the fluid mechanics is revealed. The flow topology results indicate that the formation of coherent vortices in the vicinity of the bifurcation apex is governed by physical process that dictates the energy and strength of the formed vortices. This is manifested by the identification of a characteristic dimensionless time-scale that combines the impulsive vortex formation with the inertia of the unsteady flow.

Consumer purchasing was examined based on the presence or absence of a promotional brochure and a price premium for red oak and yellow poplar surfaced-four-sides (S4S) boards. This research also compared typical demographic factors for purchasers and non-purchasers of FSC certified S4S boards. Finally, the study examined subscales from a previously designed ecoscale to determine whether two of the subscales were effective predictors of the sale of FSC certified boards.  Due to significant interactions between the price premium and the promotional brochure, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) statistics could not be interpreted. However, these strong interactions indicate that these two factors are interdependent. Examining respondents' understanding of the trade term, \"certification,\" showed that most did not understand the term as it is used by the forest products industry. Respondents did not link certification directly with the environment, but rather stated that it was a measure of quality excellence. This illustrates that the forest products industry must use more specific descriptions that consumers will understand when referring to certification.  Based on survey results from this study, a large proportion of respondents who paid more for FSC certified boards were unable to recall whether they had cost any more than the alternative product. Respondents of this study were not found to have a high level of confidence in the environmental claims of any group. These included forest products companies, industry associations, and independent organizations. The subscales of a previously designed ecoscale were not found to be strong indicators of a respondents' likelihood to purchase FSC certified S4S boards.  This project should be seen as a starting point for additional researchers interested in studying actual purchase decisions of consumers of environmentally conscious products, such as certified hardwood boards.

To implement this strategy an expected profit margin is estimated based on the amount of pork, corn price, and soybean meal price. The profit margin that can be 'locked in' by the futures market is calculated from the futures prices of live hogs, corn and soybean meal with an allowance for other cost. The hedging rule is to hedge hogs, corn and soybean meal when a profit margin of fifty percent above the expected profit margin can be 'locked-in' with the futures. In their original paper, using data from 1975-82, Kenyon and Clay found this method of hedging stabilized cash flow while increasing the overall profit level. Using out-of-sample data from 1983-98, the current research finds no difference in profits from hedging versus not hedging. The most obvious reason for the lack of success is the inability to predict the expected profit margin with the simple supply model used by Kenyon and Clay. Addition of demand shifting variables to the model failed to significantly improve the prediction of expected profit margin or the hedging results. The hedging strategy was also affected by a significant decrease in the variance in the futures market that lead to a decrease in hedging opportunities. With the failure of the Kenyon and Clay hedging strategy with out-of-sample data, this research empirically demonstrates the need for out-of-sample testing of selective hedging strategies.

The test specimen was an internally pressurized, aluminum cylindrical shell reinforced with two externally bonded aluminum tear straps around its circumference. The shell contained an initial, axial through-crack centered between the straps. The crack propagated slowly in the axial direction as the pressure increased above a certain value until a maximum pressure was attained, and then the crack propagated dynamically. The tear straps sufficiently toughened the shell such that the dynamic crack path bifurcated near the edges of the straps. The bifurcated crack branches ran circumferentially, parallel to the straps causing the shell wall to flap open. The STAGS analysis for the static equilibrium configurations of the fractured shell include geometric nonlinearity and elastic-plastic material behavior. The crack tip opening angle (CTOA) is used in the criterion for ductile crack growth, and the critical value of the CTOA is determined by correlating the STAGS predictions of the stable portion of the crack growth curve (internal pressure versus half crack length) to the test. With the employment of a new STAGS algorithm, the complete axial crack growth curve, including both the stable and unstable portions, through the tear strap is obtained. The complete axial crack growth curve indicates that crack growth through the strap is unlikely. STAGS models with long cracks which bifurcate at various half crack lengths are developed to assess the location of crack bifurcation. Three different stress based crack turning criteria are investigated from the axial crack growth results as a second method for assessing a location of bifurcation. The bifurcation analyses and stress based turning criteria corroborate the experimentally measured bifurcation point. A parametric study is then conducted to determine the influence of tear strap thickness and width on the location of crack bifurcation.

Studies estimate that between 5 and 20 percent of stream-gaging data may be marked as missing for one reason or another. Reconstructing or infilling missing data methods generate larger sets of data. These larger data sets generally generate better estimates of the sampled parameter and permit practical applications of the data in hydrologic or water quality calculations. This study utilizes data from a watershed monitoring program operating in the Northern Virginia area to(1) identify and summarize the major reasons for the occurrence of missing data; (2) provide recommendations for reducing the occurrence of missing data; (3) describe methods for infilling missing chemical data; (4) develop and evaluate methods for infilling values to replace missing chemical data; and (5) recommend different infilling methods for various conditions. An evaluation of different infilling methods for chemical data over a variety of factors (e.g., amount of annual rainfall, whether the missing chemical parameter is strongly correlated with flow, amount of missing data) is performed using Monte Carlo modeling. Using the results of the Monte Carlo modeling, a Decision Support System (DSS) is developed for easy application of the most appropriate infilling method.

The Queston Physician Network, a subsidiary of Biological & Popular Culture, Inc., attempts to centralize the administrative, financial, and telecommunication needs of a network of primary care physicians located throughout the United States. The VSE, running on the NeXTSTEP operating system, is a discrete event simulation software package with the capability to tackle the complexities associated with such a network design. The advantages of VSE over other simulation languages include its visualization of objects, domain independence, and object-oriented design and modeling.  The objective of the Queston simulation model is to addresses the performance capabilities of the physician network operationally centralized in the Queston Information Center. Additionally, the model could be used to analyze a physician-patient encounter of a generic clinic to identify recommended staffing and scheduling schemes. Object-oriented programming allows the objects in the model to be instantiated at the time of execution. This feature permits the creation of one flexible generic clinic that can be reused to produce several identical clinics at program execution. In this model, one generic, family practice clinic and the Queston Information Center are created. Input data provided by both medical experts and a time study are used. Verification and validation techniques are applied in all phases of the modeling effort.

Social network approval as well as positive role models in the form of older siblings was also instrumental in lending support to the success and general positive attitude felt by participants about the geographic separation. Methods of communication included the telephone and e-mail, which was substituted or supplementary when high phone bills created financial concerns for the respondents. Variation in physical visitation was due to the intersection of academic schedule, affordable transportation, attitude towards work disruptions, geographic distance, and a general willingness to travel. Participants told a story of the geographic separation as both a temporary and necessary inconvenience, rather than a major obstacle or focal point of the relationship. Future directions for studying long-distance dating relationships include collecting couple data and examining gender differences to determine if sex has an impact on how geographic separation is viewed.

The combination of heavy labor demands on women and a weaning diet low in calories takes its toll on women and children during the pre-harvest lean season. In 1995, the Small-Scale Sesame Oil Production project introduced an inexpensive, manual technology for edible oil extraction, called the ram press, to women in The Gambia. The overall aim of the project was to improve household nutritional security through the adoption of the ram press by women sesame growers. A 13-month study was conducted to evaluate the success of the Small-Scale Sesame Oil Production project. The study involved 120 rural households40 households with access to motorized expeller technology (Expeller group) for sesame oil extraction, 37 households with access to manual ram press technology (Press group), and 43 households with access to both technologies (Combination group). Twenty-four hour recalls, food frequency data, anthropometric measurements, and production data were obtained at the baseline and at the post-harvest, peak sesame oil-pressing, and pre-harvest lean seasons. At the baseline, women in the Expeller group had higher mean intakes of kilocalories than those in the Press and Combination groups. After introduction of the ram press, the Press and Combination women reported consistently higher intakes of kilocalories than the Expeller women at all seasons, with the largest differences at the peak oil-pressing and pre-harvest lean seasons. At the baseline, the consumption of kilocalories for Expeller children was greater than that of the Combination and Press children. After introduction of the ram press, this trend was reversed and the intake of kilocalories for Combination and Press children was greater than that of Expeller children at all other seasons. The Expeller children exhibited a marked increase in weight-for-height z-scores at the peak oil-pressing season that decreased to near baseline levels thereafter. The Combination and Press children exhibited a steady increase in weight-for-height z-scores across seasons except for the pre-harvest lean season when their scores leveled off. These results indicate that women and children in households with access to ram press technology experience much less of a seasonal fluctuation in food consumption than those without ram press technology. Findings of this study also indicate that when women are given choices as to which technology is best for them, they will maximize their benefits from the available technologies.

Among different categories of these sensors is the Extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometer (EFPI) sensor which is inherently simple and requires only modest amount of interface electronics. These advantages make it suitable for many practical applications. Investigating a cost-effective, reliable and repeatable method for optical fiber sensor fabrication is challenging work. In this thesis, a system for controlled fabrication of Fabry-Perot optical fiber sensors is developed and presented as the first attempt for the long-term goal of automated EFPI sensor fabrication. The sensor fabrication control system presented here implements a real-time control of a carbon dioxide (CO₂) laser as sensor bonding power, an optical fiber white light interferometric subsystem for real-time monitoring and measurement of the air gap separation in the Fabry-Perot sensor probe, and real-time control of a piezoelectric (PZT) motion subsystem for sensor alignment. The design of optoelectronic hardware and computer software is included. A large number of sensors are fabricated using this system and are tested under high temperature and high pressure. This system as a prototype system shows the potential in automated sensor fabrication.

Based on an extensive literature review as well as discussion with industrial partners, it was determined that there is no tool available for assisting engineers in determining reliable estimates of their production capabilities as they introduce new board designs onto their current production lines. Motivated by this need, a more in-depth study of manufacturing yield as well as the electronic assembly process was undertaken. The relevant literature research was divided into three main fieldsprocess modeling, board design, and PCB testing. The model presented in this research combines elements from process modeling and board design into a single yield model.  An optimization model was formulated to determine the fault probabilities that minimize the difference between actual yield values and predicted yield values. This model determines fault probabilities (per component type) based on past production yields for the different board designs assembled. These probabilities are then used to estimate the yields of future board designs. Two different yield models were tested and their assumptions regarding the nature of the faults were validated. The model that assumes independence between faults provided better yield predictions. A preliminary case study was performed to compare the performance of the presented model with that of previous models using data available from the literature. The proposed yield model predicts yield within 3% of the actual yield value, outperforming previous regression models that predicted yield within 10%, and artificial neural network models that predicted yield within 5%.  A second case study was performed using data gathered from actual production lines. The proposed yield model continued to provide very good yield predictions. The average difference with respect to the actual yields from this case study ranged between 1.25% and 2.27% for the lines studied. Through sensitivity analysis, it was determined that certain component types have a considerably higher effect on yield than others. Once the proposed yield model is implemented, design suggestions can be made to account for manufacturability issues during the design process.

Specially designed craneships are used for this task, however the wave-induced motions of the ship can cause large pendulations of cargo being hoisted by a ship-mounted crane. This makes cargo transfer in rough seas extremely dangerous and therefore transfer operations normally cease when sea state 3 is reached. If the cargo pendulations could be reduced in higher sea states, transfer operations would be possible.  By controlling the boom luff angle, one can reduce the cargo pendulations in the plane of the boom significantly. A two-dimensional pendulum with a rigid massless cable and massive point load is used to model the system. A control law using time-delayed position feedback is developed and the system is simulated on a computer using the full nonlinear equations of motion. A three-degree-of-freedom ship-motion simulation platform, capable of simulating heave, pitch, and roll motions, was built. The computer simulation results were experimentally verified by mounting a 1/24th scale model of a T-ACS crane on the ship-motion simulation platform.

Fifty-three to 74% of all first attempts resulted in a chase and 24% to 44% of these bears treed. A 2nd chase occurred in 11% to 96% of attempts and 9% to 50% of bears treed. Five to 17% of the 1st bears and 13% to 21% of 2nd bears were harvested. Field surveys found virtually no differences in hunting effort or success between seasons, study areas, and years. The hunter diary appears to be the most reliable means of sampling hunter effort and success. The applicability of Schroeder's physical condition estimate (PCR) was tested on data from Maine's black bear population. Bears exposed to poor hard mast had lower PCR's than bears exposed to good hard mast (P = 0.009). PCR and body weights of adult female black bears in Virginia exposed to hunting did not differ from those not hunted (P = 0.09). Annual adult female, adult male, and cub survival and reproductive rates in the hunted population were numerically similar to those in the non hunted populations. Five radio collared females were experimentally chased by hounds. The chases,on average, lasted 0.9 hours and 43% of bears treed. The average total home range for 3 of the bears was 17.8 km².

Commercially available anthrax vaccines for immunization of humans are of limited duration and do not protect against the respiratory form of the disease. Brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular bacterium that causes chronic infection in animals and humans. As with other intracellular pathogens, cell mediated immune responses (CMI) are crucial in affording protection against brucellosis. B. abortus strain RB51 has been shown to be useful in eliciting protective cell mediated immunity and humoral responses against Brucella in cattle and other animal species. Since the protective antigen (PA) of B. anthracis is known to induce protective antibodies, it was decided that the objective of this research was to test whether the gene encoding PA could be expressed in Brucella producing a bivalent vaccine to protect against both brucellosis and anthrax. The pag gene was transcriptionally fused to promoters of genes encoding superoxide dismutase or heat shock protein groE, subcloned into a broad host range plasmid (pBBR1MCS) and shown to express in E. coli by immunoblotting using antiserum specific for PA. The immunoblot results revealed that E. coli produced a PA protein of the expected size. In addition, the culture medium was shown to contain the same PA protein using immunoblotting. These results show that E. coli is capable of expressing B. anthracis PA in both the cellular and extracellular forms. The pBB/PA plasmid was used to transform B. abortus RB51 and CmR clones screened for the expression of PA by immunoblotting. Twenty clones of strain RB51/pBBSOD were show to express a 30kDa PA protein. Three clones of strain RB51/pBBGroE-PA were shown to express a 63-83kDa protein as detected by antiserum specific for PA. Using the A/J mouse, an immunocompromised vertebrate model, immunization and challenge studies were performed. Preliminary results demonstrate that the bivalent vaccine is capable of producing protection against a live challenge with B. abortus and some protection against live non-disease producing spores of B. anthracis.

Sputtering yield data at these energies are important for ion thruster design and lifetime prediction. The basic principles of sputtering phenomena are discussed. An overview of various popular types of experimental sputtering yield methods is presented with an emphasis on the techniques that have been used to find Xe+-Mo sputtering yields in the past. Sputtering yields in this study are found through both models and experiments.  Sputtering yields are calculated using the Sigmund, Bohdansky, Yamamura, and Wilhelm formulas. The computed sputtering yields for these models varied widely at low-energy. TRIM (The TRansport of Ions in Matter), a Monte-Carlo simulation program, was adapted to study sputtering yields, and energy and angular distributions of sputtered atoms. Simulations were run at various combinations of ion energy and ion incidence angle. TRIM did not prove to be an adequate model for low-energy sputtering. Experimental measurements of sputtering were made using both Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and mass-loss methods. Sputtering was performed in a small vacuum facility using an ion gun. For the RBS technique, sputtered material was collected on aluminum foil substrates. The area density of the deposited Mo film on the substrates was measured using RBS. These measurements enabled calculation of differential sputtering yields, which were integrated to find the total sputtering yield. Sputtering yield was found by the mass-loss technique by simply comparing the mass of the sample both before and after sputtering using a microbalance. Sputtering yields at 100 eV, 90 eV, 80 eV, 70 eV, and 60 eV were found using the RBS technique. The mass-loss technique was only successful in the 80 eV experiment. The experimental results were unexpected. The measured sputtering yields were significantly higher than those reported by other researchers. Also, sputtering yields were found to increase with decreasing ion energy from 90 eV down to 60 eV.

Its development was aimed at increasing the UMTS network'­s capacity and optimizing performance. The increase in the number of wireless users requires an increase in the number of smaller WLAN cells in order to maintain an acceptable level of QoS. Deploying smaller cells in areas of higher mobility (e.g., campuses, subway stations, city blocks, malls, etc.) results in the user only spending a short period of time in each cell, which significantly increases the rate of handoff. If the user does not spend sufficient time in the discovered WLAN's coverage area, the application cannot benefit from the higher data rates. Therefore, the data interruption and performance degradation associated with the handoff cannot be compensated for. This counters the initial objective for integrating heterogeneous technologies, thus only handoffs that are followed by a sufficient visit to the discovered WLAN should be triggered. The conventional RF-based handoff decision method does not have the necessary means for making an accurate decision in the type of environments described above. Therefore, a location-aided handoff decision algorithm was developed to prevent the triggering of handoffs that result from short visits to discovered WLAN's ­ coverage area. The algorithm includes a location-based evaluation that runs on the network side and utilizes a user's location, speed, and direction as well as handoff-delay values to compute the minimum required visit duration and the user'­s trajectory. A WLAN coverage database is queried to determine whether the trajectory's end point falls within the boundaries of the discovered WLAN's coverage area. If so, the mobile node is notified by the UMTS network to trigger the handoff. Otherwise, the location-based evaluation reiterates until the estimated trajectory falls within the boundaries of the discovered WLAN'­s coverage area, or the user exits the coverage area. By taking into consideration more then merely RF-measurements, the proposed algorithm is able to predict whether the user'­s visit to the WLAN will exceed the minimum requirements and make the decision accordingly. This allows the algorithm to prevent the performance degradation and cost associated with unbeneficial/unnecessary handoffs.

These programmatic elements were used as guides for the development of multiple figure-ground relationships at a variety of scales. In addition, the dialogue between different figures as well as the careful development of the backdrop surfaces were topics of study. Several design strategies were employed to create relationships between figure elements and their backdrops, including the insertion of volumes into and through one another, the careful development of material and surface, and light. From this work, as well as previous projects, several key findings can now be articulated concerning the potential use of figure-ground relationships in the development of a work of architecture. These include the need to optimize the proportion of figure(s) relative to a given background and the key role that the disposition of figures relative to one another plays in the development of a meaningful figure-ground relationship.

The rate of convective heat transfer to the panel core is controlled by its permeability. Permeability in the plane of the panel also controls the flow of vapor to the panel edges, thereby influencing the potential for panel \"blowing\". This research considers how flake thickness, flake alignment and changing mat density during hot-pressing influences OSB mat permeability, through its thickness and in the plane of the panel. Some previous research exists but it fails to address the affects of horizontal and vertical density gradients as well as flake alignment.  An apparatus was designed to allow cold pressing of aligned flakes to desired densities while enabling permeability measurements through the mat thickness. An additional apparatus was designed to allow the measuring of permeability in the plane of the mat. These designs permitted permeability measurements in mats that had no vertical density gradient, allowing for the direct study of permeability versus density (compaction ratio). Superficial permeability was determined using Darcy's law and for each sample, multiple readings were made at five different pressure differentials. Permeability through the mat thickness was highly dependent on compaction ratio and to a lesser extent flake thickness. As the compaction ratio is increased, the initial reduction in permeability is severe, once higher compaction ratios are achieved the reduction in permeability is less pronounced. Permeability decreased with decreasing flake thickness. Permeability in the plane of the mat decreases with increasing compaction ratio but in a less severe manner than through the mat thickness. In this case, the permeability-compaction ratio relationship appears linear in nature. Again, permeability decreases with decreasing flake thickness.

Extant data from thirty couples self-reporting violence in their relationship, was used. Individual audiotaped interviews from a study unrelated to attachment were transcribed. Ten interviews (five couples) were selected for coding. Applying the modified analytic induction method, as outlined by Gilgun, the data fell into thematic categories that provided a foundation for a narrative about each dyadic system. Representative constructs such as internal working models, adult attachment, caregiving, automatic arousal and abandonment, emerged naturally from the data. The iterative nature of the methodology demanded continual refinement and refocusing. The participants'­ words painted the picture of violence in their relationship. Direct quotes authenticated the research and gave it an experiential aspect. Results demonstrated that attachment theory is an excellent lens through which to study intimate partner violence, suggesting it be embraced in future family systems research.

However, the beneficial effects of non-crop vegetation on soil quality, nutrient cycling, and biodiversity have not been thoroughly explored. A study was conducted to determine the effects of harvesting-induced soil disturbance, bedding and chemical vegetation control on soil processes and productivity, and to characterize the effects of silvicultural treatments on non-crop vegetation dynamics. Study plots were established on a wet pine flat on South Carolina's lower Coastal Plain. Treatments included a range of 5 disturbance classes (undisturbed, compression tracked, shallowly rutted, deeply rutted and churned), two site preparation treatments (flat planted and bedded) and a gradient of vegetation control (no vegetation control, operational-level weed control and complete weed control). Soil disturbances had relatively small effects on soil quality. Soil compaction reduced soil aeration, but this condition was fully ameliorated by bedding. Churning did not degrade the soil physical environment in any measureable way, largely because slash and litter were incorporated into the surface soil. Bedding and churning increase soil biological activity, which increased nitrogen mineralization in excess of pine demand. When non-crop vegetation was chemically controlled, mineralization rates increased due to increases in surface soil temperatures. With less vegetation on the site, the amount of nitrogen sequestered was less, furthering the potential for nitrogen loss by leaching or denitrification. Soil quality improved somewhat with increasing levels of non-crop vegetation biomass; however, these beneficial effects were marginal during two years of operational vegetation control. The majority of dominant species on undisturbed treatment areas were woody, and soil disturbance, including bedding, reduced the proportions of these species. Silvicultural treatments had little effect on the prevalence of hydrophytic species on these wetland study sites. From a forest management point of view, for this site type, it appears that much is gained by reducing competition from non-crop vegetation; the benefits of controlling the density of non-crop vegetation for encouraging early pine growth are clear. While non-crop vegetation slightly improved system function by sequestering available nitrogen, increasing diversity and increasing soil quality, these improvements do not appear to be critical to forest function on these inherently high-quality sites.

The turbulence can be near the noise level of current microscale profiling techniques and these techniques do not provide spatially and temporally dense measurements and can be labor intensive. A 5 beam acoustic Doppler current profiler (VADCP) can more accurately measure three components of fluid velocity in a column. By towing such a device in a sensor platform, called a towfish, one may measure turbulent mixing in a vertical swath of the ocean. If the towfish attitude is not precisely regulated, however, the turbulence measurements can be irreversibly corrupted. A two-part tow that includes a depressor weight between the towing vessel and the towfish can provide some degree of disturbance rejection. Passive devices alone, however, can not meet the performance requirements for measuring ocean turbulence. This thesis presents a design for a two-stage towing system which will be used to measure ocean turbulence. The focus is on the towfish, which includes independently actuated stern planes for pitch and roll disturbance rejection. The thesis also describes design and analysis of an active control system to precisely regulate the pitch and roll attitude of a streamlined towfish. A three dimensional numerical model is presented and a PID controller is developed to provide active attitude stabilization. The effect of random depressor motions on the towfish dynamics is assessed for both the uncontrolled and the feedback-controlled case. The numerical investigation also considers variations in parameters such as tether length and CG location.

Lejeune has shown that the canonical form of autobiography is characterized by the equation author=narrator=character. However, if we apply this clear-cut definition to Vallejo's book, a series of question ariseWho is speaking in his novels? Can we unequivocally attribute the narrator's ideas to Vallejo himself? Or if his novels are mere autobiographies, why does Vallejo use some blatantly fictitious situations? Fernando Vallejo'­s work underscores the fine boundary between fiction and autobiography and the impact that this relation has on his readers. In his writing, the present time and past time are fused in the capricious channel of his memory, confirming that every autobiography, no matter how sincere it is, is also a form of storytelling.

This experiment was prematurely terminated due to predation on mussels by fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Experiment 2 evaluated growth and survival of juvenile rainbow mussels in outdoor troughs and indoor aquaria. There was no significant difference in survival or growth between the two systems. Experiment 3 used troughs similar to those in Experiment 2 to rear E. capsaeformis and L. fasciola under two silt regimes. Survival for Experiment 3 was significantly greater for L. fasciola. The comparison between silt regimes indicated that individuals in the high-silt treatment had better survival than those in the low-silt treatment. The difference between these 2 treatments may be a reflection of increased escapement in the low-silt treatment, which may have resulted from more frequent disturbance during sampling. Growth of L. fasciola was significantly greater than E. capsaeformis, and was greater in the low-silt treatment. A habitat survey of the Clinch River, Virginia was conducted from Blackford, Clinch River Kilometer (CRK) 478 to the Tennessee border, CRK 325. Physical characteristics identified in the survey were combined with water quality and impact source data to develop a habitat suitability index for freshwater mussels within this study reach. Model parameters were indexed and weighted to give a final suitability ranking. Habitat units having the highest overall ranking includedNash Ford (CRK 449), Artrip (CRK 442), several riffles and runs below Carterton (CRK 417), upstream of Mill Island (CRK 389.5), and Pendleton Island (CRK 365), and Speers Ferry (CRK 333-325). Potential locations for habitat restoration projects and additional monitoring were also identified.

This thesis focuses specifically on the Washington DC Metro Area Transportation Authority's (WMATA) Metrorail, aiming to reshape the entrance segment of this public transportation experience by increasing both appeal and accessibility. The design process began with primary and secondary design research, using observational and interactive methods to produce an informed picture of Metrorail users'­ current perspectives. A design strategy was then developed from the collective research findings, which led to a period of blue-sky ideation and finally the design of elegant and accessible mass transit entrance system components.

Mobile ad hoc networks have been mostly utilized in military environments. The recent advances in ad hoc network technology now introduce a new class of applications.  In this thesis, we design, implement and analyze a multi-hop ad hoc messenger application using Pocket PCs and Microsoft .Net Compact Framework. Pocket PCs communicate wirelessly with each other using the IEEE 802.11b technology without the use of an infrastructure. The main protocol implemented in this application is based on Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), which consists of two important mechanisms, Route Discovery and Route Maintenance. We adopt DSR since DSR operates solely based on source routing and \"on-demand\" process, so each packet does not have to transmit any periodic advertisement packets or routing information. These characteristics are desirable for the ad hoc messenger application for which a conversation is source-initiated on-demand.  To test our application easily, we have developed a testing strategy by which a mobility configuration file is pre-generated describing the mobility pattern of each node generated based on the random waypoint mobility model. A mobility configuration file thus defines topology changes at runtime and is used by all nodes to know whether they can communicate with others in a single-hop or multi-hops during an experimental run.  We use five standard metrics to test the performance of the wireless ad hoc messenger application implemented based on DSR, namely, (1) average latency to find a new route, (2) average latency to deliver a data packet, (3) delivery ratio of data packets, (4) normalized control overhead, and (5) throughput. These metrics test the correctness and efficiency of the wireless ad hoc messenger application using the DSR protocol in an 802.11 ad hoc network that imposes limitations on bandwidth and resources of each mobile device. We test the effectiveness of certain design alternatives for implementing the ad hoc messenger application with these five metrics under various topology change conditions by manipulating the speed and pause-time parameters in the random waypoint model. The design alternatives evaluated include (1) Sliding Window Size (SWS) for end-to-end reliable communication control; (2) the use of per-hop acknowledgement packets (called receipt packets) deigned for rapid detection of route errors by intermediate nodes; and (3) the use of cache for path look-up during route discovery and maintenance. Our analysis results indicate that as the node speed increases, the system performance deteriorates because a higher node speed causes the network topology to change more frequently under the random waypoint mobility model, causing routes to be broken. On the other hand, as the pause time increases, the system performance improves due to a more stable network topology. For the design alternatives evaluated in our wireless ad hoc messenger, we discover that as SWS increases, the system performance also increases until it reaches an optimal SWS value that maximizes the performance due to a balance of a higher level of data parallelism introduced and a higher level of medium contention in 802.11 because of more packets being transmitted simultaneously as SWS increases. Beyond the optimal SWS, the system performance deteriorates as SWS increases because the heavy medium contention effect outweighs the benefit due to data parallelism. We also discover that the use of receipt packets is helpful in a rapidly changing network but is not beneficial in a stable network. There is a break-even point in the frequency of topology changes beyond which the use of receipt packets helps quickly detect route errors in a dynamic network and would improve the system performance. Lastly, the use of cache is rather harmful in a frequently changing network because stale information stored in the cache of a source node may adversely cause more route errors and generate a higher delay for the route discovery process. There exists a break-even point beyond which the use of cache is not beneficial. Our wireless ad hoc messenger application can be used in a real chatting setting allowing Pocket PC users to chat instantly in 802.11 environments. The design and development of the dynamic topology simulation tool to model movements of nodes and the automatic testing and data collection tool to facilitate input data selection and output data analysis using XML are also a major contribution. The experimental results obtained indicate that there exists an optimal operational setting in the use of SWS, receipt packets and cache, suggesting that the wireless ad hoc messenger should be implemented in an adaptive manner to fine-tune these design parameters based on the current network condition and performance data monitored to maximize the system performance.

This speed range is the order of the vertical speed considered in a survivable crash on a runway. Transient response characteristics and failure sequence are compared to nominally identical frames tested quasi-statically in a previous study. The peak load at the first major failure event and the corresponding displacement are larger in impact tests than in the quasi-static tests. However, the fracture sequence in the vicinity of the impact location is similar to what was observed in the static tests. Preliminary transient simulations of the frame impact tests using the LSDyna software were also performed. Using the available composite material failure criteria in the software, reasonable correlation was achieved between the simulation and the tests on the load-displacement plot. The computed strains distributions did not compare as well to the measured strains at the first major failure event.

All specimens were designed according to the \"thick plate\" procedure contained in AISC Design Guide 16, Flush and Extended Multiple-Row Moment End-Plate Connections. A displacement-controlled history was used to load the specimens. Experimental maximum moments were compared to analytical predictions of beam and connection strength. Also, each moment versus rotation relationship was analyzed for compliance with the requirements of Ordinary, Intermediate, and Special Moment Frames, as defined by AISC in the Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings. The experimental results demonstrated that the thick plate procedure in Design Guide 16 is an accurate model for predicting the strength of the connection elements, and the procedure is recommended for designing connections subject to cyclic (seismic) loads.

Despite the plethora of literature on the international system and comparative state politics, relatively little addresses the interpenetration of international and domestic systems in intermestic issues. This thesis explores intermestic processes. It argues that states' domestic policies are increasingly formed in an intermestic context and such intermesticity has brought states a dilemma between maintaining effective domestic control and achieving integration into the global economy. This thesis examines China's SARS policy formation in 2003 as a case study. How did the internal health problem come to be addressed in an intermestic context in a country noted for its tight domestic control and long-term aversion to foreign intervention? The question is approached through a textual analysis of the story of China's SARS policy development. This study also identifies the patterns of international influence on China's domestic politics, particularly in the SARS crisis. I interpret the intermestic dynamic as a learning process through which China has chosen to embrace international institutions in its pursuit of national interests in a globalized world.

In a multipath-rich wireless channel, deploying multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver achieves high data rate, without increasing the total transmission power or bandwidth. When perfect knowledge of the wireless channel conditions is available at the receiver, the capacity has been shown to grow linearly with the number of antennas. However, the channel conditions must be estimated since perfect channel knowledge is never known a priori. In practice, the channel estimation procedure can be aided by transmitting pilot symbols that are known at the receiver. System performance depends on the quality of channel estimate, and the number of pilot symbols. It is desirable to limit the number of transmitted pilot symbols because pilot symbols reduce spectral efficiency.  This thesis analyzes the system performance of coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems for the quasi-static fading channel. The assumption that perfect channel knowledge is available at the receiver must be removed, in order to more accurately examine the system performance. Emphasis is placed on developing channel estimation strategies for an iterative Vertical Bell-Labs Layered Space Time (V-BLAST) architecture. The channel estimate can be sequentially improved between successive iterations of the iterative V-BLAST algorithm. For both the coded and uncoded systems, at high signal to noise ratio only a minimum number of pilot symbols per transmit antenna are required to achieve perfect channel knowledge performance.

In the visual domain, it seems that human infants prefer stimuli (e.g., flashing displays) presented at faster relative rates. Research using avian species has shown that ducklings, for example, prefer their species- specific maternal call only when it is presented at values close to the species-typical mean. These studies have shown that experience affects ducklings'­ preferences for rate in auditory events. Researchers in the areas of human infant preferences for visual rate and avian infant preferences for auditory rate have suggested that an effective window of frequencies exists for which infants show maximal attention. Unlike these two areas, little research has addressed how rate affects human infants' preferences for auditory events. A study by Cooper and Cooper (1997) was the first to find that infants attend to rates of speaking infant directed (ID) speech. Specifically, infants preferred ID speech at its normal rate to ID speech at a faster rate. The present study was intended to further investigate how rate of speaking affected infants' preferences for ID speech. More specifically, this study sought to determine whether a window of effective rates also exists for infant preferences for rate in ID speech. Using an infant-controlled preference procedure, 20 six- to eight-week old infants were presented with ID-normal speech (ID speech as its normal rate) and ID- slow speech (ID speech slowed to half the normal rate). It was found that infants looked longer to a visual display when it was paired with ID-slow speech than when it was paired with ID-normal speech. How these results relate to research and theory on visual rate preferences in human infants and auditory rate in avian species is discussed, as well as future directions for this line of research.

While these techniques enable greater performance, they also increase the complexity and silicon area of the design. This creates larger development and testing times. The shrinking feature sizes associated with newer technology increase wire resistance and signal propagation delays, further complicating large designs. One potential solution is the Single-Chip Message-Passing (SCMP) Parallel Computer, developed at Virginia Tech. SCMP makes use of an architecture where a number of simple processors are tiled across a single chip and connected by a fast interconnection network. The system is designed to take advantage of thread-level parallelism and to keep wire traces short in preparation for even smaller integrated circuit feature sizes. This thesis presents the implementation of the MPI (Message-Passing Interface) communications library on top of SCMP's hardware communication support. Emphasis is placed on the specific needs of this system with regards to MPI. For example, MPI is designed to operate between heterogeneous systems; however, in the SCMP environment such support is unnecessary and wastes resources. The SCMP network is also designed such that messages can be sent with very low latency, but with cooperative multitasking it is difficult to assure a timely response to messages. Finally, the low-level network primitives have no support for send operations that occur before the receiver is prepared and that functionality is necessary for MPI support.

Historical industrial practices in Waynesboro, Virginia left portions of the Shenandoah River basin contaminated with mercury and stringent health advisories for fish consumption. I investigated processes affecting the bioaccumulation of mercury in Catostomus commersoni, Ictalurus punctatus, Lepomis auritus, and Micropterus dolomieu by studying food habits, total mercury and methylmercury in common prey items, and bioaccumulation dynamics of methylmercury in the mercury contaminated South River and South Fork of the Shenandoah River and uncontaminated North River. Additionally, I evaluated sexual and seasonal variations of total mercury in M. dolomieu in the South Fork of the Shenandoah River.  Algae, aquatic insects, crayfish, detritus, and fish accounted for 75-97% of the diet. Total mercury in aquatic invertebrates and forage fish in contaminated rivers ranged from 66.7-398.3 and 198.0-594.9 ng/g wet weight, while total mercury in aquatic invertebrates and forage fish in the reference river were 4.4 and 29.3 ng/g. Model simulations indicated that dietary pathways accounted for 87% of methylmercury uptake by fish in contaminated rivers, but only 57% in the reference river. Total mercury in M. dolomieu was 19-20% higher in females than males and 14-21% higher during spring than summer and fall. Results of this study indicate that bioenergetics-based bioaccumulation models are valuable tools for evaluating field data, identifying processes critical to contaminant accumulation, and comparing outcomes of alternative management options associated with pollution control, ecosystem management, and/or restoration activities for management guidance prior to costly expenditures.

Under aerobic conditions, oxygen acts as the terminal electron acceptor in microbial respiration and Fe(III) (hydr)oxides are highly insoluble, thus arsenic remains associated with Fe(III) (hydr)oxide phases. However, under anaerobic conditions Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms can couple the reduction of solid phase Fe(III) (hydr)oxides with the oxidation of organic carbon. When ferric iron is reduced to ferrous iron, arsenic is mobilized into groundwater. Although this process has been documented in a variety of pristine and contaminated environments, minimal information exists on the mechanisms causing this arsenic mobilization. Arsenic mobilization was studied by conducting controlled microcosm experiments containing an arsenic-bearing ferrihydrite and an Fe(III)-reducing microorganism, Geobacter metallireducens. Results show that arsenic mobility is strongly controlled by microbially-mediated disaggregation of arsenic-bearing iron nanoparticles. The most likely controlling mechanism of this disaggregation of iron oxide nanoparticles is a change in mineral phase from ferrihydrite to magnetite, a mixed Fe(III) and Fe(II) mineral, due to the microbially-mediated reduction of Fe(III). Although arsenic remained associated with the iron oxide nanoparticles and was not released as a hydrated oxyanion, the arsenic-bearing nanoparticles could be readily mobilized in aquifers. These results have significant implications for understanding arsenic behavior in aquifers with Fe(III) reducing conditions, and may aid in improving remediation of arsenic-contaminated waters.

There are numerous systems that can be incorporated into vehicles and various ways in which the information can and should be presented to the driver. The way the information is presented to the drivers is extremely important in terms of increasing safety and decreasing driver distraction. The expected outcomes of this research included the development of human factors guidelines for the design and use of in-vehicle information systems. It was a desirable goal to identify the most suitable information presentation formats for certain tasks, since this may influence the drivers' attention and driving performance. This study focused on how the factors of interest may affect drivers' attention and driving performance while performing IVIS secondary tasks related to specific applications. This was accomplished through an on-road within-factors experiment. Sixteen participants performed secondary tasks related to three IVIS applications at two levels of difficulty. The tasks were presented using five types of displays. Data collected from video and in-vehicle sensors were statistically analyzed to determine significant effects between the factors. Driving performance, external reaction time, and perceived mental workload results were compiled into general guidelines for the design and use of IVIS. The findings of this study strongly suggest that visual displays should not be used for the presentation of IVIS. Auditory and multi-modal (i.e. both visual and auditory interface) displays are the most appropriate ways to present IVIS information. A normal speech rate is preferred over a fast speech rate. IVIS tasks should be kept as simple as possible in terms of the number of steps. From the three manipulated factors (type of display, IVIS application, and task level of difficulty), the type of display had the largest number of significant results across the dependent variables measurements. The visual display led to the worst driver performance, while auditory and multi-modal displays yielded significantly better driving performance.

Because of its intrinsic economic benefits, the development of true potato seed (TPS) cropping systems has been instituted in many regions of the world. The incorporation of transgenic resistance could further the economic gain of farmers who are seeking ways to sustain their livelihood in the most efficient way possible. It is, however, largely unresearched how sexual hybridization of a transgenic crop would affect the behavior of a transgene in the resultant progeny. In the initial part of this study, transgenic lines were developed with a Cry3Aa transgene. These plants were then used in 4x-4x reciprocal crosses and 4x-2x hybridization schemes to determine the stability of the transgene after sexual hybridization. There was no observed parent of origin effect on transgene expression; however, a highly significant, non-mendelian inheritance of the Cry3Aa transgene was seen in the maternally inherited transgene of one set of progeny from a reciprocal cross. Additional transgenic lines of potato were developed with a PVY-O coat protein transgene. These plants were challenged with PVY-O and monitored for symptoms visually and for virus serologically. One transgenic line exhibited complete resistance to PVY-O while two others showed a delay in symptom occurrence. Further examination of the expression levels of the PVY-O coat protein transgene will be necessary to determine the type and usefulness of the observed resistance.

But cv.Everest retained texture (firmness) better after 35 days of storage. Overall results indicate that shrink wrap packaging and shorter post harvest cooling delays protect quality of broccoli.

Alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol were extracted with hexane, separated by high performance liquid chromatography on a normal-phase diol column, and quantified. Significant differences (P<0.001) in concentration were found among species for all forms of tocopherol. Alpha-tocopherol predominated, accounting for more than 90% of the total tocopherols in all three species. Alpha-tocopherol levels increased in all species with maturity; however, the magnitude of the increase was not the same in all species. At the end of the growing season, autumn olive had the highest levels of alpha-tocopherol (1270 ± 55 ppm dry matter [DM]), followed by Morrow's honeysuckle (840 ± 55 ppm DM), and multiflora rose (610 ± 55 ppm DM). Goats grazing on mature browse may obtain adequate intake of vitamin E. High nutritive value and/or low concentrations of antiquality factors may not coincide with the high levels of vitamin E found in mature tissue, and the actual vitamin E intake will depend on the feeding behavior of the goat.

Over the decades, a number of researchers dedicated their time to understanding the dynamics that govern the attenuation of hearing protectors. This thesis duplicates some of this work with newer technology and better data processing ability. In addition to revitalizing the accepted knowledge of hearing protector technology, this thesis is the first documented effort to show how the previously ignored air leak, known to exist between the ear cup and the head, has a profound effect on the low and mid frequency attenuation of a circumaural hearing defender.  Past research focused on the mechanical vibration of the cup on the seal as the main source of noise within the ear cup. This mechanical vibration, known as the piston resonance exists, and affected noise attenuation within the ear cup. A reasonably sized air leak of 160 e-7 m2 however, overwhelmed the piston resonance. An air leak of this size was shown to degrade noise attenuation by over 50 dB at 40Hz and 30 dB at 200 Hz when compared to a no-leak case. Further testing also suggested that the air leak has the ability to continue adding energy into the cup up to 3000 Hz.

In this method, some parameters are assumed to be accurate (e.g. natural frequencies, mode shapes and mass matrix), while others are adjusted so that the eigenvalue equation is satisfied. Updating is done with the use of principal submatrices, and the method seeks the best parameters multiplying these matrices. This is a departure from classical model reference, and is closer to the formulation of sensitivity methods. The submatrices allow updating of the stiffness matrix with certain freedom while preserving connectivity. Closed form solution can be achieved through multiple ways; two different approaches, denoted as the Quadratic Compression Method (QCM) and the Full Vector Method (FVM), are described in this paper. It is shown that the QCM possesses superior robustness properties with respect to noise in the data. This fact, as well as the simplicity offered by QCM, is demonstrated theoretically and experimentally. The experiments are presented to show the advantage of the QCM in the updating process.

Of particular interest is the 5-6 GHz Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (UNII) band intended to support high-speed WLAN applications. The UNII band is further split into three smaller 100 MHz sub-bands5.15 - 5.25 GHz; 5.25-5.35 GHz; and 5.725-5.825 GHz.  VCOs that can be switched between each of the three UNII sub-bands offer flexibility and optimum phase-locked loop (PLL) design versus non-switchable VCOs. This work presents switched-tank voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs) designed in MotorolaÃ Â­s 0.18 Ã Âµm HIP6WRF BiCMOS process that could be used in multiband receivers covering the three UNII sub-bands. The first VCO was optimized for low power consumption. The VCO draws a total of 6.75 mA from a 1.8 V supply including buffer amplifiers. The VCO is designed with a switched-capacitor LC tank circuit that can switch to two center frequencies, 5.25 GHz and 5.775 GHz, with 200 MHz of varactor-supplied tuning range. The simulated output voltage swing is 2.0 V peak-to-peak and is kept constant between sub-bands by an active PMOS load integrated into the biasing circuitry. The second VCO was optimized for a high output voltage swing by replacing the current biasing circuit with a degenerating inductor. This design targeted three center frequencies, 5.2 GHz, 5.3 GHz, and 5.775 GHz, with 100 MHz of tuning range. This design has an output peak-to-peak voltage swing of 5.2 V but consumes an average of 16.5 mA from a 1.8 V supply. The two fabricated circuits exhibit tuning ranges similar to the simulated results; however, the center frequencies of each decrease due to interconnect parasitics there were unaccounted for in the designs. The measured center frequencies are 4.4 GHz and 5.37 GHz for the first design, and 4.4 GHz and 4.7 GHz for the second design (with one state inoperative due to a faulty switch).  The phase noise of the fabricated VCO designs was limited primarily by the low quality factor (Q-factor) of the on-chip LC tank circuits. Oscillators referenced with high-Q off-chip components such as quartz crystal references and surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators in a PLL can exhibit much improved performance; however, these off-chip components add packaging/assembly cost and higher bill of materials, impedance matching issues, and parasitics that can significantly affect performance for RF applications. Thus, there is tremendous incentive for integrating high-Q components on-chip with the eventual goal of consolidating all of the RF/analog/digital components onto a single wireless-enabled chip, commonly called RF system-on-a-chip (SoC).  Microelectromechanical (MEM) resonators have received significant attention based on their ability to provide high on-chip Q-factors at RF frequencies using fabrication techniques that are compatible with modern IC processes. MEM resonators transduce electrical signals into extremely low-loss mechanical vibration and vice versa. Consequently, this thesis also describes the modeling, simulation, and fabrication of contour-mode disk-shaped MEM resonators. This resonator geometry is capable of providing high-Q oscillation at frequencies exceeding 1 GHz at sizes easily within the limits of modern photolithography techniques. Finite element analysis is used to predict the frequency response of disk resonators under various operating conditions and to determine variables that are most critical to the resonator design. A silicon-on-insulator (SOI) fabrication process for constructing the disk is also discussed. Finally, the possible future integration of MEM resonators with multiband VCOs in a common IC process is proposed.

One of the sub-fields of software engineering is metrics, which seeks to measure software products and processes. This allows for prediction of certain attributes such as quality. There are several software toolkits that exist in virtual reality that have not had formal software engineering methodologies applied during their development. This research looks at applying knowledge gained from the metrics discipline to the software toolkits used in virtual reality.

They consist of three main components. That is, a compressor followed by a combustion chamber (burner) and a turbine. Both turbine and compressor components are either axial or centrifugal (radial) in design. The combustion chamber is stationary on the engine casing. The type of engine that is of interest here is the gas turbine auxiliary power unit (APU). A typical APU has a centrifugal compressor, burner and an axial turbine. APUs generate mechanical shaft power to drive equipments such as small generators and hydraulic pumps. In airplanes, they provide cabin pressurization and ventilation. They can also supply electrical power to certain airplane systems such as navigation. In comparison to thrust engines, APUs are usually much smaller in design.  The purpose of this research was to investigate the possibility of combining the three components of an APU into a single centrifugal rotor. To do this, a set of equations were chosen that would describe the new turbomachinery cycle. They either were provided or derived using quasi-one-dimensional compressible flow equations. A MathCAD program developed for the analysis obtained best design points for various cases with the help of an optimizer called Model Center. These results were then compared to current machine specifications (gas turbine engine, gasoline and diesel generators). The result of interest was maximum specific power takeoff. The results showed high specific powers in the event there was no restriction to the material and did not exhaust at atmospheric pressure. This caused the rotor to become very large and have a disk thickness that was unrealistic. With the restrictions fully in place, they severely limited the performance of the rotor. Sample rotor shapes showed all of them to have unusual designs. They had a combination of unreasonable blade height variations and very large disk thicknesses. Indications from this study showed that the single radial rotor turbomachinery design might not be a good idea.

Four methods for assessing the annual tributary phosphorus loads to two different Virginia reservoirs were analyzed, three methods that use tributary monitoring program data and one that uses land-use and rainfall data. In this project, one tributary has been extensively monitored for many years and served as a control on which the other methods were tested. The key difference between this research and previous studies is the inclusion of flow-weighted composite storm sampling instead of simple grab sample analyses of storm flow. Three of the methods employed flow stratification, and the impact of the base flow separation point was examined. It was found that the Regression Method developed in this research was the least sensitive to the base flow separation point, which is a valuable attribute because a wrong choice will not significantly affect the estimate. The Monte Carlo Method was found to underestimate the TP loads. The amount of rainfall impacted the accuracy of the methods, with more error occurring in a year with lower precipitation.

This process involves the sorption of pesticides onto an organic matrix followed by degradation in a composting environment. We are now evaluating the hazards that might be associated with land-applying composted pesticide waste. Diazinon was the first pesticide selected for evaluation, which consisted of two studies. The first used the earthworm species Eisenia foetida to evaluate the toxicity of soil amended with composted diazinon waste. The second study determined the bioavailability of delta-2-14C-diazinon and its degradation products to E. foetida in soil amended with composted delta-2-14C-diazinon.  Results from the first study indicate that uncomposted diazinon sorbent and 30-day composted diazinon sorbent were toxic to E. foetida at sublethal and lethal levels. However, E. foetida exposed 60-day composted diazinon sorbent did not experience mortality or demostrate sublethal effects commonly associated with acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Earthworms exposed to diazinon that was uncomposted or composted for 30 days in the radiolabelled study experienced higher mortality than in the field study. After 30 and 60 days of composting 14C-diazinon became unextractably incorporated into organic matter and very little was mineralized. Earthworms were shown to accumulate radioactivity when exposed to soil amended with 60- day composted delta-2-14C-diazinon. The majority of this radioactivity was unextractably bound to earthworm tissue and that which was extractable contained only trace levels of delta-2-14C-diazinon. Based on the absence of toxicity in the field study and the low levels of 14C-diazinon present in earthworm tissues, 60 days of composting appears to greatly reduce the hazard that diazinon rinsate poses to E. foetida.

This model incorporates O₂ species and ion transport while taking a discrete look at the platinum particles within the active layer. The original 2-dimensional axisymmetric Thin Film and Agglomerate Models of Bultel, Ozil, and Durand [8] were initially implemented, validated, and used to generate various results related to the performance of the active layer with changes in the thermodynamic conditions and geometry. The Agglomerate Model was then further developed, implemented, and validated to include among other things pores, flooding, and both humidified air and humidified O₂. All models were implemented and solved using FEMAP™ and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver, developed by Blue Ridge Numerics Inc. (BRNI) called CFDesign™. The use of these models for the discrete modeling of platinum particles is shown to be beneficial for understanding the behavior of a fuel cell. The addition of gas pores is shown to promote high current densities due to increased species transport throughout the agglomerate. Flooding is considered, and its effect on the cathode active layer is evaluated. The model takes various transport and electrochemical kinetic parameters values from the literature in order to do a parametric study showing the degree to which temperature, pressure, and geometry are crucial to overall performance. This parametric study quantifies among a number of other things the degree to which lower porosities for thick active layers and higher porosities for thin active layers are advantageous to fuel cell performance. Cathode active layer performance is shown not to be solely a function of catalyst surface area but discrete catalyst placement within the agglomerate.

A design is presented for a precast solar water heating system used to aid in meeting the space and domestic water heating loads of a single family residence. A three-dimensional transient collector model is developed to characterize the precast solar collector's performance throughout the day. The model describes the collector as a series of segments in the axial direction connected by a fluid flowing through an embedded tube. Each segment is represented by a two-dimensional solid model with top boundary conditions determined using a traditional flat plate solar collector model for convection and radiation from the collector cover plate.  The precast collector is coupled to a series solar assisted heat pump system and used to meet the heating needs of the residence. The performance of the proposed system is compared to the performance of a typical air to air heat pump. The combined collector and heat pump model is solved using Matlab in conjunction with the finite element solver, Femlab.  Using the system model, various non-dimensional design and operating parameters were analyzed to determine a set of near optimal design and operating values. The annual performance of the near optimal system was evaluated to determine the energy and cost savings for applications in Atlanta, GA and Chicago, IL. In addition, a life cycle cost study of the system was completed to determine the economic feasibility of the proposed system. The results of the annual study show that capturing solar energy using the precast collector and applying the energy through a solar assisted heat pump can reduce the electricity required for heating by more than 50% in regions with long heating seasons. The life cycle cost analysis shows that the energy savings justifies the increase in initial cost in locations with long heating seasons but that the system is not economically attractive in locations with shorter heating seasons.

At the time of this survey, the watershed encompassed approximately 929 hectares of mine and forest lands with a small recreational area. Black Creek proper is a third-order stream approximately 6.7 km in length from its headwaters to its confluence with the Powell River in Kent Junction. Black Creek and several of the tributaries within the watershed were previously identified as areas impacted by acid mine drainage. The watershed was used in a study to identify sources of acid mine drainage and the best methods for its evaluation.  The acid mine drainage sources were first identified using visual inspection and field chemistry. Additional stream segments were then included in the assessment process using metal (aluminum, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, and zinc) analyses of both overlying water column and sediments.  Using an upstream reach of Black Creek as a reference, short-term toxicity testing was employed, as well as a long-term purge study. The pH at sampling locations ranged from 2.75 to 7.87 SU, and conductivity ranged from 196 μmhos/cm to 2040 μmhos/cm. All metals were elevated when compared to the reference. Water column samples collected from locations with low pH were acutely toxic to Daphnia magna and Pimephales promelas. Mortality was high in the elutriant test at locations where pH was low, conductivity was elevated, metals were high, or a combination of these.  In the initial sediment tests, all sampling locations were significantly different than the reference for survival of Chironomus tentans and reproduction of D. magna. One location was significantly different than the reference for survival of D. magna. In the sediment tests completed after two months, survival of C. tentans was only different from the control in three locations but was significantly different for growth at all locations. Reproduction by D. magna was again significantly less than the reference at all locations. At eight months, only two locations were significant for survival of C. tentans and after 15 months, no significant differences occurred between any stations. The study indicates that stream segments that are severely impaired by acid mine drainage are easy to identify using visual inspection and field water chemistry. Those that are moderately impaired require more investigation and may not be responsive to short-term toxicity tests.  Benthic macroinvertebrates, leaf packs, and periphyton were evaluated in the field. Benthic macroinvertebrate communities and leaf-pack breakdown were evaluated at nine locations, while periphyton was evaluated at the mouth of Black Creek, as well as five sites in the Powell River receiving system. While leaf-pack information and benthic macroinvertebrate samples yielded similar information, benthic sampling was much simpler and less time consuming. Additionally, benthic macroinvertebrate sampling, particularly over several sampling events, was more sensitive at the most severely impacted AMD stations.  The stations were broken down into five different categories in order to better determine which evaluation techniques were most sensitive and cost-effective. The five categories were Non-Impaired, Slightly Impaired, Moderately Impaired, Severely Impaired, and Severely pH impaired. Once the locations were categorized, each method used to evaluate toxicity was examined to determine which methods best identified acid mine drainage impairment in the Black Creek watershed. The methods utilized include the followingbasic water chemistry; metals analysis of sediments and water column; acute toxicity testing using both D. magna and P. promelas; short-term elutriant and sediment tests; chronic sediment test using C. tentans and D. magna; a purge study; benthic macroinvertebrate sampling; leaf-pack and algal-tile studies. After evaluating these methods, it was determined that using basic water chemistry and benthic macroinvertebrate sampling were the best methods for evaluating acid mine drainage impairment in this watershed.  The reference station was identified as Non-Impaired. Two stations located in the lower portions of Black Creek (L11 and L1) were also Non-Impaired or only Slightly Impaired with the benthic macroinvertebrate results indicating little impairment. Stations U2, U6, U7, and BBM were also found to be Slightly Impaired. The station on the margin of the wetland, U5, was Moderately Impaired.

The double difference algorithm is used to calculate accurate relative hypocenter locations by removing the effects of un-modeled velocity structure. The study examines the earthquake hypocenter relocations in an effort to resolve fault orientations and thereby gain insights into the tectonics of the seismic zone. The analysis involves visual comparison of three-dimensional perspective plots of the hypocenter relocations oriented according to focal mechanism nodal planes derived from events within several, dense clusters of earthquakes. The northwestern boundary of the seismic zone corresponds to the steep magnetic gradient of the New York-Alabama lineament. The double-difference relocations reinforced previous interpretations of a vertical boundary between seismic and relatively aseismic crust at that location. Areas at the northeastern and southwestern ends of the ETSZ exhibit northwest trending hypocenter alignments, which are perpendicular to the overall northeastern trend of the seismic zone. These alignments agree with focal mechanism nodal plane orientations and are interpreted as seismogenic faults. In the central, most seismically active portion of the ETSZ, relocations appear to indicate a diffuse zone of hypocenters that are west-striking and north-dipping. The orientation of this zone of earthquake hypocenters is consistent with an existing seismic reflection profile that images mid to upper crustal reflectors with apparent dips of approximately 35 degrees to the north.  The interpreted fault planes are all consistent with an east-northeast oriented, sub-horizontal maximum regional compressive stress, consistent with findings in previous studies.

Context comprises of user'­s computing platform, the environment in which the user is interacting with the application and user characteristics which comprise of user's behavior during interaction and user preferences for interface display and interaction. We present a framework for adaptive user interface generation where adaptation occurs when context changes. This framework introduces three new concepts. First, formalization for representing context is introduced. Our design of context specification is unique since it reflects the association of context with level and nature of user interface adaptation. Secondly, user interface generation life cycle is studied and we define a context model on top of task model to introduce the contextual conditions into user interface generation process. Using the context model, user interface designer can specify contextual requirements and its effect on the user interface. Third, context aware adaptation of user interfaces is achieved by mapping context specifications to various levels of user interface generation life cycle. We designed a specification language called rule specification using which the user interface designer can specify the mapping. With the new design of context representation, context model, and rule specification, we demonstrate how changes in contexts adapts task model which in turn adapts the user interface.

The Morlet wavelet is defined and procedures for choosing its parameters are described. The recovery of modulation characteristics using the Morlet wavelet is demonstrated. Hydrodynamic linear stability is reviewed and its application to steady and unsteady mixing layers is discussed. Modulation effects are demonstrated by using the magnitude and phase of the wavelet coefficients. The time-varying characteristics of the most unstable modes are determined using the real part of the wavelet coefficients. It is found that mean flow unsteadiness increases the amplitude and phase modulation of the mixing layers. Synchronized variations of the two most unstable modes, the fundamental and the subharmonic, are also observed in the region of subharmonic growth. In a second application of wavelet analysis, the phase lag of the wavelet coefficients is used to determine the phase relation between the fundamental and the subharmonic in acoustically forced mixing layers. The results show that selective forcing affects the time-variations of the phase relation. In a third application, the magnitude and phase of the wavelet coefficients are used to decompose propagating waves measured at a single location.

The blades were tested in a 2D transonic windtunnel. The exit Mach number ranged from 0.60 to 1.15 and the incidence was varied from -34o to 35o. Measurements included downstream Pitot probe traverses, upstream total pressure, and endwall static pressures. Flow visualization techniques such as shadowgraph photography and color oil flow visualization were performed to complement the measured data. When the exit Mach number for both nozzles increased from 0.9 to 1.1, the total pressure loss coefficient increased by a factor of 7 as compared to the total pressure losses observed at subsonic condition (M2<0.9). For the range of incidence tested, the effect of flow incidence on the total pressure losses is less pronounced. Based on shadowgraphs taken during the experiment, it's believed that the large increase in losses at transonic conditions is due to strong shock/boundary layer interaction that may lead to flow separation on the blade suction surface. From the measured total pressure coefficients, a modified loss model that accounts for higher losses at transonic conditions was developed. The new model matches the data much better than the existing Kacker-Okapuu model for transonic exit conditions.

The goal of this research is to propose, improve, and implement an algorithm capable of finding terms (words in a corpus) that are used in similar ways--a term categorizer. Such a term categorizer can be used to find a particular part-of-speech, i.e. nouns in a corpus, and generate a lexicon. The proposed work is not dependent on any external sources of information, such as dictionaries, and it shows a significant improvement (~30%) over an existing method of categorization. More importantly, the proposed algorithm can be applied as a component of an unsupervised part-of-speech tagger, making it truly unsupervised, requiring only unannotated text.

Typically, man-made composites demonstrate interfacial fracture at failure due to abrupt transitions between neighboring phases. This phenomenon does not occur in wood because gradual phase transitions exist between regions of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin and therefore adhesion between adjacent phases is increased. The formation of interphases occurs as a consequence of the self-assembly process which governs the formation of wood. If this process was understood more thoroughly, perhaps tougher man-made, biobased composites could be prepared. To study self-assembly phenomena in wood, a system composed of a model copolymer (pullulan abietate, DS=0.027) representing the lignin-carbohydrate complex (LCC) and a model surface for cellulose fibers was used. The self-assembly of the polysaccharide pullulan abietate (DS=0.027) onto a regenerated cellulose surface prepared using the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique was studied via surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Rapid, spontaneous, and desorption-resistant cellulose surface modification resulted when exposed to the model LCC. Adsorption was quantified using the de Feijter equation revealing that between 9-10 anhydroglucose units (AGUs) adsorb per nm&178; of cellulose surface area when cellulose is exposed to pullulan abietate (DS=0.027) compared to the adsorption of 6.6 AGUs per nm&178; of cellulose surface area when cellulose is exposed to unsubstituted pullulan.

Most network controllers used in small appliances or for specialized purposes are built using micro controllers. However there are many applications where a hardware-oriented approach using Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) or Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) is more suitable. One of the features of FPGAs that cannot be integrated into ASICs is runtime reconfiguration in which, certain portions of the chip are reconfigured at runtime while the other parts continue to operate normally. This feature is required for network controllers with multiple data transfer channels that need to preserve the state of the static channels while reconfiguration is taking place. It is also required for controllers with space constraints in terms of FPGA resources or time constraints in terms of reconfiguration times. This thesis explores the impact of partial reconfiguration on the performance of a network controller. An FPGA-based network controller that supports partial reconfiguration has been designed and constructed. Partial bitstreams that can configure certain channels of the network controller without a ecting the functioning of others have been created. Experiments have been performed that quantify the manner in which, the performance of the controller can be changed by loading these partial bitstreams onto the FPGA. These experiments demonstrated the advantages of using partial reconfiguration to change network-related parameters at runtime to optimize performance of the network controller.

This study expands upon this work by correlating clinical and neuropathological findings in these modifications of OPIDN. To provide appropriate models of OPIDN, single phenyl saligenin phosphate (PSP) dosages of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.5 mg/kg were administered to adult hens. PMSF (90 mg/kg) was given either 4 hours after or 12 hours prior to PSP administration. Clinical signs and pathologic changes in the biventer cervicis nerve (El-Fawal et al., 1988) were monitored. PSP alone, 2.5 mg/kg, ellicitated severe OPIDN (terminal clinical score 7.5 & ± 1.0 [0-8 scale]; neuropathology score 2.7 ± 0.3 [0-4 scale, based on myelinated fiber degeneration]). PMSF given 12 hours prior to PSP gave complete protection (clinical and neuropathology scores of 0; p<0.0001). Signs and lesions of OPIDN were absent following 0.5 mg/kg PSP alone, but PMSF given 4 hours after PSP potentiated its neurotoxic effects (clinical score 4.0 ± 0.0; neuropathology score 3.5 ± 0.3; p<0.0001). At the time of sacrifice, there was a correlation (r = 0.61) between the clinical score on the last day of observation and the neuropathology scores (p<0.0001). This study demonstrates that the intensity of peripheral nerve myelinated fiber degeneration correlates with clinical deficits in PMSF-induced potentiation and protection in OPIDN.

In the current study, we investigated the role of CD44 in Con A induced hepatitis. Although immune cells have been identified as the causative agent of Con A-induced hepatitis, the exact mechanism of pathogenesis remains unclear. When Con A was injected into CD44 wild type (WT) mice, it induced hepatitis as evident from increased plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels accompanied by active infiltration of mononuclear cells in the liver and significant induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, Con A injected C57BL/6 CD44-knockout (KO) mice exhibited increased hepatitis with higher levels of apoptosis in the liver and increased plasma AST levels when compared to the CD44 WT mice. Also, transfer of T cells from Con A injected CD44-KO mice into CD44 WT mice induced higher levels of hepatitis when compared to transfer of similar cells from CD44 WT mice into CD44 WT mice. The increased hepatitis seen in CD44-KO mice was partially due to increased production of cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-2 and IFN-g, but not Fas or FasL. Also, it was not caused by altered presence of T cell subsets. The increased susceptibility of CD44 KO mice to hepatitis correlated with increased resistance of T cells from CD44 KO mice to undergo apoptosis when compared to the CD44 WT mice. Together, these data demonstrate that activated T cells use CD44 to undergo apoptosis, and dysregulation in this pathway could lead to increased pathogenesis in a number of diseases, including hepatitis.

Species have been described on the basis of macromorphology and spore shape and size. This study was initiated to investigate populations of M. arenaria from Namibia in Africa and the Southwestern United States. It was hypothesized that biological species would exist in the widely separated populations. Spores from single sporocarps were germinated, single spore isolates were obtained and selfed to obtain mating types. On transfer, clamp connections were not maintained and mating patterns could not be achieved. Nuclear staining revealed multinuclei in the hyphae of both single spore isolates and compatible crosses. Spores were stained and found to have either 1 or 2 nuclei, but only four sterigmate basidia were observed. Limited partial compatibility was achieved and in some cases clamp connections formed within and between crosses from the two continents. Genomic DNA was extracted from old herbarium specimens. The ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS4 regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA were amplified and sequenced directly. Phylogenetic analysis using PAUP was performed. The hypothesis that Montagnea would form different biological species based on continental separation was rejected. In fact, the complex of isolates from widely varying locations not only had partial compatibility, but the variation in ITS sequences among widely distributed collections was relatively low. Lastly, no correlation between sporocarp size and gene flow among specimens from a wide variety of habitats was found. It appears that M. arenaria is a single, highly variable, widely distributed species.

Each child participated in three interview sessions. The children's thoughts on themes, roles, object substitutions, pretense and play negotiation were described. The children's symbolic play in the classroom and during the interviews was described in relation to the claims of documentation. The role of documentation in children's symbolic play was discussed. Recommendations for future use of documentation and children's symbolic play were made.

It is a contribution to the research of efficient and low cost devices that implement the advantages of active and passive noise control techniques. A theoretical model has been developed to investigate the potential of this new \"active-passive distributed absorber\". The model integrates new functions that make it extremely stable numerically. Using this model, a genetic algorithm has been used to optimize the shape of the active-passive distributed absorber. Prototypes have been designed and their potential investigated. The device subsequently developed can be described as a skin that can be mechanically and electrically tuned to reduce unwanted vibration and/or sound. It is constructed from the piezoelectric material polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and thin layers of lead. The tested device is designed to weight less than 10% of the main structure and has a resonance frequency around 1000 Hz. Experiments have been conducted on a simply supported steal beam (24\"x2\"x1/4\"). Preliminary results show that the new treatment out-performs active-passive point absorbers and conventional constrained layer damping material. The compact design and its efficiency make it suitable for many applications especially in the transportation industry. This new type of distributed absorber is totally original and represent a potential breakthrough in the field of acoustics and vibration control.

We monitored 98 (48M:50F) black bear cubs equipped with expandable radio-collars (Higgins 1997) or radio transmitters implanted subcutaneously between 1995 and 1999 to estimate cub survival. Kaplan-Meier staggered entry analysis provided 306-day survival rates for 82 cubs. The survival estimates for males and females were 73% (0.49, 0.96) and 91% (0.80, 1.00), respectively. The overall 306-day survival rate for all cubs was 81% (0.67,0.94) using Kaplan-Meier and 76% (0.63, 0.92) using Heisey-Fuller (Mayfield) methods.

Among flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) controllers, the SSSC has shown feasibility in terms of cost-effectiveness in a wide range of problem-solving abilities from transmission to distribution levels. Referring to the literature reviews, the CMC with separated DC capacitors is clearly the most feasible topology for use as a power converter in the SSSC applications. The control for the CMC-Based SSSC is complicated. The design of the complicated control strategy was begun with well-defined system transfer functions. The stability of the system was achieved by trial and error processes, which were time-consuming and ineffective.   The goal of this thesis is to achieve a reliable controller design for the CMC-based SSSC. Major contributions are addressed as follows1) accurate models of the CMC for reactive power compensations in both ABC and DQ0 coordinates, and 2) an effective decoupling power control technique.  To simplify the control system design, well-defined models of the CMC-Based SSSC in both ABC and DQ0 coordinates are proposed. The proposed models are for the CMC-Based SSSC focus on only three voltage levels but can be expanded for any number of voltage levels. The key system transfer functions are derived and used in the controller design process. To achieve independent power control capability, the control technique, called the decoupling power control used in the design for the CMC-Based STATCOM is applied. This control technique allows both the real and reactive power components to be independently controlled.   With the combination of the decoupling power control and the cascaded PWM, a CMC with any number of voltage levels can be simply modeled as a three-level cascaded converter, which is the simplest topology to deal with. This thesis focuses on the detailed design process needed for a CMC-Based SSSC.

Such wireless sensor networks can provide remote monitoring and control of operations of large-scale systems using low-power, low-cost, \"throw-away\" sensor nodes. This thesis focuses on two aspects of wireless sensor node development(1) post-IC assembly of nanosensor devices onto prefabricated complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits using a technique called dielectrophoretic (DEP) assembly; and (2) design of a low-power SiGe BiCMOS multi-band ultra-wideband (UWB) transmitter for wireless communications with other nodes and/or a central control unit in a wireless sensor network.   For the first part of this work, a DEP assembly test chip was designed and fabricated using the five-metal core CMOS platform technology of Motorola's HiP6W low-voltage 0.18_m Si/SiGe BiCMOS process. The CMOS chip size was 2.5mm x 2.5 mm. The required AC signal for assembling nanowires is provided to the bottom electrodes defined in the Metal 4 (M4) layer of the IC process. This signal is then capacitively coupled to the top/assembly electrodes defined in the top metal (M5) layer that is also interconnected to appropriate readout circuitry. The placement and alignment of the nanowires on the top electrodes are defined by dielectrophoretic forces that act on the nanowires. For proof of concept purposes, metallic rhodium nanowires ((length = 5μm and diameter = 250 nm) were used in this thesis to demonstrate assembly onto the prefabricated CMOS chip. The rhodium nanowires were manufactured using a nanotemplated electroplating technique. In general, the DEP assembly technique can be used to manipulate a wider range of nanoscale devices (nanowire sensors, nanotubes, etc.), allowing their individual assembly onto prefabricated CMOS chips and can be extended to integrate diverse functionalized nanosensors with sensor readout, data conversion and data communication functionalities in a single-chip environment. In addition, this technique provides a highly-manufacturable platform for the development of multifunctional wireless sensor nodes based on assembled nano-sensor devices.   The resistances of the assembled nanowires were measured to be on the order of 110 Ω consistent with prior prototype results. Several issues involved in achieving successful assembly of nanowires and good electrical continuity between the nanowires and metal layers of IC processes are addressed in this thesis. The importance of chemical/mechanical planarization (CMP) technique in modern IC processes and considerations for electrical isolation of readout circuit from the assembly sites are discussed.   For the second part of this work, a multi-band hopping ultrawideband transmitter was designed to operate in three different frequency bands namely, 4.8 GHz, 6.4 GHz and 8.0 GHz. As a part of this effort, this thesis includes the design of a CMOS phase/frequency detector (PFD), a CMOS pseudo-random code generator and an on-chip passive loop filter, which were designed for the multi-band PLL frequency synthesizer. The CMOS PFD provided phase tracking over a range of -2π to +2π radians. The on-chip passive loop filter was designed for a 62_ phase margin, 250 μA-charge pump output current and 4 MHz-PLL loop-bandwidth. The CMOS pseudorandom code generator provided a two-bit output that helped switch the frequency bands of the UWB transmitter. With all these components, along with a BiCMOS VCO, a CMOS charge pump and a CMOS frequency divider, the simulated PLL frequency synthesizer locked within a relatively short time of 700ns in all three design frequency bands. The die area for the multi-band UWB transmitter as laid out was 1.5 mm x 1.0 mm.   Future work proposed by this thesis includes sequential assembly of diverse functionalized gas/chemical nanosensor elements into arrays in order to realize highly sensitive \"electronic noses\". With integration of such diverse functionalized nano-scale sensors with low-power read-out and data communication system, a versatile and commercially viable low-power wireless sensor system can be realized.

Oxidative stress on the brain is thought to contribute to neuron cell death and to the onset of Parkinson's disease. Reactive oxygen radicals produced during oxidative stress have been implicated as an initiator of neuron destruction. Glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, can initiate OH radical formation when present in excess. Oxidative stress on the brain caused by glutamate overflow may be monitored by trapping the OH radicals with salicylic acid to produce 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA). Determination of this product is initially performed using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) coupled with UV detection to establish optimum separation conditions. These conditions were applied for rapid, efficient, and sensitive determination of 2,3-DHBA by CZE coupled with electrochemical detection. Quick and sensitive detection of 2,3-DHBA is essential in monitoring OH radical generation and identifying its role in Parkinson's disease.

The stress response selected in this work is the glutathione-gated potassium efflux (GGKE) system, which responds to electrophilic stress by effluxing potassium from the interior to the exterior of the cell. Thus, the bulk potassium in solution can be monitored as an indicator of bacterial stress. By utilizing this stress response in a biosensor, the efflux of potassium can be correlated to the stress response of the immobilized culture, providing an early warning system for electrophilic shock. This type of shock is a causative factor in many process upset events in wastewater treatment plants, so the application of the sensor would be an early warning device for such plants.  The research conducted here focused on the biological element of the biosensor under development. Three immobilization matrices were explored to determine the cell viability and potassium efflux potential from immobilized cellsa calcium alginate, a photopolymer, and a thermally reversible gel. The calcium alginate was unstable, and dissolved after five days, such that the long-term impact of immobilization on the cells could not be determined in the matrix. The photopolymer resulted in very low actvity and viability of immobilized cellsOf the three matrices tested, indicating that the composition of the polymer was toxic to the cells. Of the matrices tested, the thermally-reversible gel showed the best response for further study, in that the matrix did not inhibit cell activity or potassium efflux.

Often, cDNA libraries representing expressed genes of an organism are available, along with expressed sequence tags (ESTs). ESTs are widely used as the probes for microarrays. Designing custom microarrays, rich in genes relevant to the experimental objectives, requires selection of probes based on their sequence. We have designed a probe selection method, called GeneSieve, to select EST probes for custom microarrays. To assign annotations to the ESTs, we cluster them into contigs using PHRAP. The larger contig sequences are then used for similarity search against known proteins in model organism such as Arabidopsis thaliana. We have designed three different methods to assign annotations to the contigsbidirectional hits (BH), bidirectional best hits (BBH), and unidirectional best hits (UBH). We apply these methods to pine and potato EST sets. Results show that the UBH method assigns unambiguous annotations to a large fraction of contigs in an organism. Hence, we use UBH to assign annotations to ESTs in GeneSieve. To select a single EST from a contig, GeneSieve assigns a quality score to each EST based on its protein homology (PH), cross hybridization (CH), and relative length (RL). We use this quality score to rank ESTs according to seven different measureslength, 3' proximity, 5' proximity, protein homology, cross hybridization, relative length, and overall quality score. Results for pine and potato EST sets indicate that EST probes selected by quality score are relatively long and give better values for protein homology and cross hybridization. Results of the GeneSieve protocol are stored in a database and linked with sequence databases and known functional category schemes such as MIPS and GO. The database is made available via a web interface. A biologist is able to select large number of EST probes based on annotations or functional categories in a quick and easy way.

Assistive equipment, such as lift and transfer aids, has helped lower work task demands and reduce back stress on patient handlers. However, limited attention has been paid to the safety, comfort and dignity of the patient in postoperative care. Research on the efficacy of self-transfer aids for patients who require limited or no assistance by nursing personnel is insufficient. Ratings of comfort and security have only been evaluated for nursing home residents in a pilot field study, in which residents rated assistive devices as generally equal to or more secure and comfortable than manual transfer methods.   The first study reports the laboratory evaluation of bed rising with the use of two self-transfer aids and bed rising unassisted. The objective was to determine muscle activity during bed rising tasks with and without the use of a bed assistive device using surface electromyography (EMG). Twenty male (n = 9; age, 33.7 ± 8.0 years) and female (n = 11; age, 34.5 ± 23.9 years) participants, with normal body mass index (BMI) ranging from 18.4 to 24.9, took part in the study. Mean and peak activity was recorded from three abdominal muscle sites. The results indicated bed rising with the use of a self-transfer device significantly reduced muscle activity compared to bed rising unassisted. Anchoring the devices at a higher height and elevating the torso further reduced muscle activity. Although no differences were observed between devices using EMG, results from the usability survey and final ranking indicated favorable ratings for the ABNOSTRAINTM prototype compared to the Bed Pull-up.   A second study was conducted to determine the efficacy of a bed assistive device in a patient population. The objective was to compare self-perceived recovery measures and usage of pain medication between patients in the control (n = 8; age, 34.0 ± 6.3years) and device (n = 7; 40.7 ± 12.4) groups. A total of fifteen female participants undergoing either abdominal hysterectomy (n = 6) or Cesarean-section (n = 9) procedures were recruited for the study. Both groups completed a total of twelve questionnaires over a five-week recovery period. Responses to self-perceived recovery measures were significantly different. In general, the device group reported higher levels of energy, less pain interference, lower perceived pain, less reliance on pain medication and returned to activities of daily living faster than the control group.   The results from the study provide clinicians or other practitioners information on the benefits of bed assistive devices for patients during postoperative recovery. Age and surgery differences should be considered when suggesting bed movement patterns with assistive intervention.

Simulating a vehicle traversing long roads is impractical and a method to produce short roads with given characteristics must be developed. By understanding the characteristics of the road, a reduced set of models can be created from which appropriate representations of the terrain can be synthesized. Understanding the characteristics of the terrain requires the ability to accurately measure the terrain topology. It is only by increasing the fidelity and resolution of terrain topology data that application of these data can be advanced. The first part of this work presents the development of a high fidelity 3-D laser terrain measurement system. The system is developed for both on-highway and off-road measurement. It is capable of measuring terrain in three dimensions, whereas current systems measure separate 2-D profiles in each wheel path of the vehicle. The equipment setup and signal processing techniques are discussed, as well as future improvements and applications of this enabling technology. The second part of this work develops a method of characterizing non-stationary road profile data using ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling techniques. The first step is to consider the road to be a realization of an underlying stochastic process. The model identification techniques are demonstrated. Statistical techniques are developed and used to examine the distribution of the residual process and the results are demonstrated. The use of the ARIMA model parameters and residual distributions in classifying road profiles is also discussed. By classifying various road profiles according to given model parameters, any synthetic road realized from a given class of model parameters will represent all roads in that set, resulting in a timely and efficient simulation of a vehicle traversing any given type of road.

Using a life course perspective as the theoretical framework for this study, I identified the factors in older adults' lives that may or may not lead to continuous participation in physical exercise throughout life. Through in-depth interviews with nine men and six women who are members of the Wellness Center in Southwest Virginia, I gained a precise understanding of how societal processes and opportunities, life course roles and transitions, and individual meanings of physical exercise influenced perceptions of participation in physical exercise. Several conclusions were drawn from the findings of this research. First, the older adults' reported perceived changes in their perceptions and definitions of physical exercise in accordance with life stages and particular roles (i.e., parenthood and career) throughout their lives. Second, the older adults' believed that geographical location and societal influences and opportunities had a tremendous impact on their participation in physical activity as children. Third, the older adults' indicated that childhood involvement in physical activity was very influential to their participation in physical activities and exercise throughout life. Fourth, changing patterns of physical activity and exercise participation were associated with altered role transitions and altered opportunities during young and middle adulthood. Fifth, retirement provided the older adults with a great deal of freedom and opportunity to participate in physical exercise. Finally, the older adults' participation in physical exercise contributed to their quality of life.

The Toms Creek Bridge, located in Blacksburg, Virginia, has been in service for six years. Meanwhile, the Route 601 Bridge, located in Sugar Grove, Virginia, has been in service for two years.  Researchers have conducted load tests at both bridges to determine if their performance has changed during their respective service lives. The key design parameters under consideration aredeflection, wheel load distribution, and dynamic load allowance.   The results from the latest tests in 2003 yield little, yet statistically significant, changes in these key factors for both bridges. Most differences appear to be largely temperature related, although the reason behind this effect is unclear. For the Toms Creek Bridge, the largest average values from the 2003 tests are 440 me for service strain, 0.43 in. (L/484) for service deflection, 0.08 (S/11.1) for wheel load distribution, and 0.64 for dynamic load allowance. The values for the Route 601 Bridge are 220 me, 0.38 in. (L/1230), 0.34 (S/10.2), and 0.14 for the same corresponding paramters.  The recommended design values for the dynamic load allowance in both bridges have been revised upwards to 1.35 and 0.50 for the Toms Creek Bridge and Route 601 Bridge, respectively, to account for variability in the data. With these increased factors, the largest strain in the toms Creek Bridge and Route 601 Bridge would be less than 13% and 12%, respectively, of ultimate strain. Therefore, the two bridges continue to provide a large factor of safety against failure.

Server-based systems offer little interactivity or concurrent visualization capabilities, while client-based systems have increased hardware requirements asking the user to provide high-end workstations. Concurrent visualization of simulation output proves execution intensive, or unusable in some situations. Creating an execution efficient and user friendly WBS system greatly improves user experience while gaining all of the benefits inherent in a web-based system such as high accessibility and ease of maintenance. In order to provide a usable concurrent visualization WBS this thesis developed the Web-Based Queuing System Simulation System (WebQS3). WebQS3 splits the responsibilities of simulation execution and simulation visualization into a client-server environment; the client is responsible for the visualization display and server is responsible for simulation execution. The system differs from many previous WBS systems in that the client-side application is developed using web-standard technologies such as HTTP, XML, SVG, and ECMAScript instead relying on Java Applets and associated technologies. Using web-standards as the foundation of the client agent opens the visualization and model construction functionality to any user that accesses the application using a web browser while also making the application more scalable in terms of user load. Implementing the client with web-standards also included the development of an asynchronous client-server communication protocol as opposed to traditional synchronous communication protocols used by Java WBS systems. The asynchronous protocol demonstrates similar or better execution performance than similar synchronous communication protocols in most quality characteristics. By creating a WBS system using web-standards implemented in most modern web browsers any user may visit the WebQS3 site and have simulation tools available for use. Providing simulation services on the web makes eases the creation of simulation models my making the tools to readily available while facilitating information sharing and collaboration over the web. The WebQS3 system serves as a model to drive research in WBS systems away from proprietary Java technologies to web standards for front-end visualization technologies.

We hypothesized that P.G. 600 altered the timing of ovulation, therefore mating gilts 12 and 24 h after first detection of estrus, as is common in the swine industry, may not have been the most appropriate breeding regimen. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of P.G. 600 on the timing of ovulation in gilts treated with Regu-mate. Randomly cycling, crossbred gilts (5.5 m of age, 117 kg BW, and 14.7 mm BF) were fed a diet containing Regu-mate to provide 15 mg/d for 18 d. Twenty-four h after Regu-mate withdrawal, gilts received i.m. P.G. 600 (n = 25) or saline (n = 25). Gilts were checked for estrus at 8 h intervals. After first detection of estrus, trans-rectal ultrasonography was performed at 8 h intervals to determine the time of ovulation. Gilts were killed 9 to 11 d after the onset of estrus to determine ovulation rate. All gilts displayed estrus by 7 d after treatment with P.G. 600 or saline. Compared with saline, P.G. 600 increased (P = 0.07) ovulation rate (14.8 + 1.1 vs. 17.5 + 1.0, respectively). The intervals from injection-to-estrus (98.4 + 2.7 vs. 110.9 + 2.7 h; P < 0.01) and injection-to-ovulation (128.6 + 2.8 vs. 141.9 + 3.2 h; P < 0.01) were decreased in gilts treated with P.G. 600 compared with gilts treated with saline. Estrus duration (54.4 + 2.3 vs. 53.7 + 2.5 h; P = 0.83), estrus-to-ovulation (30.2 + 2.0 vs. 31.7 + 2.2 h; P = 0.62) and time of ovulation as a percentage of duration of estrus (55.8 + 2.7 vs. 57.5 + 3.0%; P = 0.67) were similar for the P.G. 600 and saline-injected gilts, respectively. In summary, P.G. 600 advanced the onset of estrus and ovulation following termination of Regu-mate treatment and increased ovulation rate. However, treatment of gilts with P.G. 600 had no effect on the timing of ovulation relative to the onset of estrus.

PCL is a hydrophobic and crystalline polyester with a glass transition temperature around -60 degrees centigrade, a melting point around 55 degrees centigrade, excellent biocompatibility, and low toxicity. In the past decade, PCL based systems have attracted considerable interest for controlled-release drug delivery and as scaffolds for tissue engineering, that require a fundamental understanding of PCL's degradation mechanisms and crystallization properties. PCL spherulites were commonly observed in previous bulk studies. This thesis focuses on PCL crystallization in Langmuir monolayers. Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) studies show that square, distorted rectangular, and dendritic crystals form at the A/W interface. While dendritic structures have been observed in poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) thin film on solid substrates, this study of PCL is the first time that dendritic morphologies have been observed at the A/W interface for a linear flexible-coil polymer. As far as we know, the crystallization of flexible-coil polymers at the A/W interface is a brand new area of research. These findings may provide an interesting model system for studying crystallization in confined geometries and the effect of crystallinity on enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of this important biodegradable polymer at the A/W interface.  The main objectives of this thesis were to investigate the phase behavior of PCL at the A/W interface, gain a deeper understanding of the nucleation and growth mechanism of PCL crystallization at the A/W interface through surface pressure-area isotherms and isobaric area relaxation analyses, and interpret the effects of molecular weight on the nucleation and growth mechanism, and morphologies of semicrystalline PCL crystallized in Langmuir monolayers at the A/W interface.

To advance the analytical process by which various scenarios for improving water quality within the estuary are examined, an array of computer-based hydrodynamic and water quality models were investigated. The Dynamic Estuary Model (DYNHYD5), developed by USEPA, was used to simulate hydrodynamics within the lower Appomattox River. The Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP6.1), also developed by USEPA, was employed to perform water quality simulations of fecal coliforms. Also, a detailed literature review examined DYNHYD5 and WASP6.1 model theory, computer-based model solution techniques, and background hydrodynamic theory. DYNHYD5 sensitivity analysis showed that the model was most responsive to tidal heights (seaward boundary conditions) both upstream and downstream within the model network. Specific model parameters were varied during calibration until modeled water surface elevations converged on observed water surface elevations. A goodness-of-fit value of 0.749 was determined with linear regression analysis for model calibration. DYNHYD5 input parameter validation was performed with additional observations and a goodness-of-fit value of 0.829 was calculated. Through sensitivity analysis, WASP6.1 proved to be most responsive to coliform loading rates in the downstream direction and boundary concentrations in the upstream direction. With these results, WASP6.1 input parameters were calibrated against observed fecal coliform concentrations. A goodness-of-fit value of 0.573 was determined with linear regression analysis for model calibration. WASP6.1 input parameter validation was performed with additional observations and a goodness-of-fit value of 0.0002 was calculated. Model results suggest that hydrodynamic model calibration and validation can be improved with additional tidal height observations at the downstream seaward boundary. Similarly, water quality model calibration and validation can possibly be improved with the aid of detailed, time-variable coliform concentrations at the downstream seaward boundary. Therefore, it is recommended that a water quality sampling station and tidal stage recorder be installed at the confluence of the Appomattox and James Rivers to provide for further testing of estuary hydrodynamic and water quality models.

The solvation energies were determined for a homologous series of betaines, (CH₃)₃N+(CH₂)nCOO- where n = 1 to 6. Their structure is composed of only the hydrophilic head group of a surfactant. The solvation energies were determined from both the gas phase energy and free energy of solution. Conformational analysis was performed on each molecule to locate the lowest energy structures and determine the Boltzmann population of each conformation for each molecule. The final solvation energies for each molecule are expectation values based on their energies and Boltzmann populations. The plotted solvation energies versus n form a parabolic curve that is similar to the literature cmc data where the betaine has a long hydrocarbon tail. However, the solvation energies peak at n = 3 and the cmc data peaks at n = 4. The dipole moments were also examined. The gas phase dipole moments were graphed and have a maximum at n = 3, similar to the solvation energy. The solution dipole moments have a linear graph, not comparable to the solvation energies. Therefore, the stability of the gas phase structures contributes more to the final solvation energy than the stability of the molecule in water.   The correlation between the plots of log cmc vs n and solvation energy vs n indicates that it is possible to computationally predict the cmc with this method. The hydrophobic contribution can be accounted for based on a known correlation between chain length and the cmc, and the hydrophilic contribution can be examined with this method. Therefore, it is possible to design a new surfactant molecule that has a cmc within the range of the biological activity to be sent for synthesis.

In 1990 nearly one out every five first time brides in the United States was under the age of 20. Although it is commonly accepted that these marriages are likely to end in divorce, there is little scientific evidence to validate that. The focus of most studies has been on negative outcomes of these marriages however little concrete evidence has been found to condemn all teen marriages as doomed. This study is a qualitative look at how six couples that married as teenagers have created successful and long lasting unions. Six white couples from the Eastern U.S. participated in 60 to 90 minute long interviews. Using a qualitative method and a phenomenological perspective this study describes the processes these couples believe are most important to their success. The couples provided their personal experiences as well as their unique perspectives on the ingredients necessary for marital success. Five major themes emerged from the couples' interviews including commitment, communication, shared values, spirituality, intimacy, and family. These five themes are common within the literature on strong marriages. In addition to these themes, the role of couple individuality and the process of growing together are discussed.

From results of area-constrained daytime searches (10 m x 10 m plots) across the landscape, I developed 9 regression models to predict amphibian relative abundance. I constructed models for each year for all plots on all habitat types, plots that were in a Stream Management Zone (SMZ), and plots that were in upland, or non-SMZ, habitat. Distance to perennial or ephemeral streams or perennial ponds (SMZ classification), the amount of available rocks along transects, and site index were the 3 most important habitat variables in models for all plots combined and were responsible for 24-32% of the inherent variation in population relative abundance. Other habitat variables that were significant in models were year, % canopy cover, the amount of available woody debris of decomposition classes 3-5 along transects, % woody stems (<7.5 cm DBH), soil pH, and % herbaceous vegetation. R2PRESS values for all 9 models ranged from 0.08 to 0.35. Amphibian relative abundance showed positive relationships with all significant habitat variables with the exception of year and % woody stems.  In natural cover object use/availability analyses, I discovered salamanders preferred rocks over woody debris, relative to the amount available of each. Salamanders preferred flat rocks to any other shape, flagstones to any other type of rock, and rock lengths in the 31-40 cm class. Preferred wood widths were in class 5-10 cm, while preferred wood lengths were in class <50 cm; salamanders exhibited strong preferences for wood in higher states of decomposition (class 3-5).  I provided baseline, preharvest data for 28-acre reference areas on 9 forest compartments scheduled for clearcuts. I sampled all 9 reference areas preharvest and sampled 3 during year 1 postharvest using coverboard and night plot surveys. On these 3 areas, species richness declined from preharvest to postharvest, but species diversity showed little change. Overall relative abundance declined significantly preharvest to postharvest with coverboard sampling (p=0.0172) and night plot sampling (p=0.0113). At coverboard stations, relative abundance declined significantly from preharvest to postharvest at a distance of 5-10 m (p=0.0163) and 40-50 m (p=0.0193) away from adjacent mature forest.   Finally, using Pianka's index, I compared the night plot and coverboard sampling techniques in terms of proportions of the 4 most common species captured. These sampling techniques on average were >80% similar for all reference areas.

This thesis considers the optimization of the Smith Mountain Lake-Leesville Pumped Storage-Hydroelectric facility. The constraints include the upper and lower reservoir capacities, downstream channel capacity and flood stage, in-stream flow needs, efficiency and capacity of the generating and pumping units, storage-release relationships, and permissible fluctuation of the upper reservoir water surface elevation to provide a recreational environment for the lake shore property owners. Two formulations are presented(1) a nonlinear mixed integer program and (2) a discretized linear mixed integer program. These formulations optimize the operating procedure to generate maximum revenue from the facility. Both formulations are general and are applicable to any pumped storage system. The nonlinear program retains the physical aspects of the system as they are but suffers from non-convexity related issues. The linear formulation uses a discretization scheme to approximate the nonlinear efficiency, pump, turbine, spillway discharge, tailrace elevation-discharge, and storage-elevation relationships. Also, there are binary unit dispatch and either/or constraints accommodating spill and gated release.  Both formulations are applied to a simplified scheme of the Smith Mountain Lake and Leesville pumped storage system. The simplified scheme uses a reduced number of generating and pumping units at the upper reservoir to accommodate the software limitations. Various sensitivity analyses were performed to test the formulations. The linear formulation consistently performs better than the nonlinear. The nonlinear solution requires a good starting point for optimization. It is most useful as a verification tool for the solution from the linear program on all occasions. The formulations yield the best schedules for generating and pumping. A coarse time interval limits the use of all pumps in the presence of the spill constraint. A sufficiently large difference in the diurnal unit price encourages short-term pump back as opposed to a weekly cycle. The Leesville (downstream) reservoir affects the power production schedule with its large (approx. 9 ft) forebay rise for every foot drop at the Smith Mountain Lake. The linear formulation provides a valuable tool for studying the system under a wide range of conditions without having to worry about the computational difficulties associated with the nonlinear formulation.

LTL shipments are routed through a network of service centers and hubs. The performance of the entire LTL distribution network is highly dependent on the speed and accuracy of the hub operations. The focus of this research effort is to improve hub operations in order to reduce costs and increase service performance levels. Specifically, new approaches are investigated for assigning trailers to dock doors and sequencing the unloading of shipments at hubs. This thesis reviews current industry practices and available research literature on hub operations. Solution approaches for the trailer-to-door assignment and freight sequencing problems are presented along with case study results. The main performance measures are bottleneck time, total labor time, and total travel distance. For the trailer-to-door assignment problem, also referred to as the hub layout problem, the three approaches investigated are the original approach, a semi-permanent approach, and a dynamic approach. For the freight sequencing problem, the five approaches evaluated are trailer-at-a-time, trailer-at-a-time with offloading, nearest neighbor within a group, nearest neighbor within a shared group, and nearest neighbor. The approaches are implemented in C++ and analyzed using data from a regional LTL carrier. The case study results indicate that the dynamic layout performs significantly better than the original and semi-permanent layout for total distance, total labor time, and bottleneck time. For total distance and total labor time, the dynamic layout with nearest neighbor sequencing is the preferred approach. For bottleneck time, the dynamic layout with trailer-at-a-time with offloading performs best, while the nearest neighbor sequencing approach performs almost as well. In general, the case study results indicate that a dynamic layout with either a trailer-at-a-time with offloading approach or a nearest neighbor approach offers the largest potential for improvement. The assumptions and results of the hub layout and freight sequencing approaches are further evaluated using a simulation model. The simulation model indicates that a dynamic layout with nearest neighbor sequencing offers the largest potential for improvement in a more realistic environment with probabilistic and dynamic events. The simulation results also indicate that the trailer-at-a-time with offloading approach may need to be modified to account for more realistic dock conditions. In summary, the approaches explored in this research offer significant opportunity to improve hub operations through reducing bottleneck time, total labor time, and total travel distance.

Water table depths, air temperature at 1-m height, soil temperature at 15-, 30-, and 50-cm depths, and CO₂ efflux were measured at 12 plots representing three landuse treatments (forest, field, and bare ground) at two restored wet flats in the thermic Great Dismal Swamp ecosystem. The forest was driest treatment. The forest air was the warmest in winter and coldest in summer, opposite of the bare ground. The forest soil at 50 cm was the warmest in winter and coolest in summer, opposite of the bare ground. Land use affected hydrology, air, and soil temperatures through the presence of surface litter and differences in shading, albedo, and ET. The regulatory frost-free period fell in between the measured frost-free period and the measured 5°C soil temperature period. Based on CO₂ efflux and soil temperature at 50 cm, the biological growing season of native plants and microbes should be year-round for forested areas, one week shorter for early-successional fields, and two weeks shorter for active cropland rather than March to November for all land uses. Changing the growing season definition of forested, thermic wet flats to year-round designation must be considered and studied carefully to avoid jeopardizing wetland hydrology qualifications.

The first objective was to assess how well the revised U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Foraging Habitat Guidelines depict good quality habitat for the red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) at Camp Lejeune, NC. To accomplish this, I used multiple linear and logistic regression to examine the relationships between fitness, habitat use, home range size, and habitat characteristics described in the guidelines. I assumed that habitat characteristics that confer quality were related to higher fitness, greater habitat use, and reduced home range size. To a large extent, the guidelines are validated. Red-cockaded woodpeckers responded favorably to habitat that mimics the historical, mature, and fire-maintained pine forests of the southeastern U.S., characterized by high densities of large pines, low densities of small and medium pines, and a lush herbaceous groundcover. Variables positively associated with habitat use and fitness were associated with reduced home range size, and those negatively associated with habitat use and fitness with increased home range size. Percent herbaceous groundcover was a significant regressor indicative of quality in every model. The second objective was to assess how well USFWS foraging partitions represent habitat used by red-cockaded woodpeckers. I conducted home range follows of 23 groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers and estimated the percentage of each home range encompassed by partitions of varying radii. The percentage of the actual home range included in the partition increased as a function of partition radius. The standard 800 m circular partition, on average, included 91% of the home range, but significant variation existed between groups.

Therefore, determining the orientation of osteons in the rib cage is an important step in understanding the behavior of the rib cage under mechanical load. A total of 37 specimens were removed from several rib locations from a male and female cadaver. Eight histological slides were created from each 5 mm long section. Image analysis included the use of a computer algorithm created in Matlab to track the center of each osteon throughout the rib section. Analysis of the results showed variations in the osteon direction between samples taken from the anterior, lateral and posterior surfaces of the rib cage. The average offset angle between the osteon direction and the rib axis was determined to be 4.1, 3.2 and 1.9 degrees for the anterior, lateral and posterior surfaces respectively. The average offset angle for the anterior specimens was significantly higher than that of the posterior rib specimens (P=0.01) The lateral specimens also showed a significantly higher average offset angle than the posterior rib specimens (P=0.01). The results indicate a trend in osteon offset angle between the three locations studied. The offset angle is highest in the anterior region, then decreases in the lateral and is lowest in the posterior regions of the rib cage.  Determining the risk of injury from an automobile collision to the thorax requires knowledge of the properties of the skeletal components that comprise the thorax. The purpose of this study was to investigate the strength of human ribs subjected to dynamic three-point bending. A total of four human cadavers were utilized by removing 16 rib sections from the right side of each thorax. One or two sections were removed from a single rib at the lateral, anterior and posterior locations of the thorax. The strain rates resulting from the dynamic loading ranged from 0.5 to 5.44 strains per second. Three-axis strain gage rosettes were used for one series of tests showing small variation of the principal strain axis from the direction of bending. For all subjects, the anterior specimens failed at a significantly lower peak stress than the lateral (p=0.01) and posterior (p=0.01) specimens. The average elastic modulus from all tests was 22 GPa. The average peak stress for all specimens was 115 MPa, with an average peak strain of 11,460 microstrain.

Distance learning courses are taught exclusively over the Internet. Economics distance courses provide alternatives for economics students to traditional classroom instruction, and also invite new students to the discipline who may not have otherwise enrolled. An increase in the number of distance courses in the economics field has sparked a debate over the ability of distance courses to provide equivalent educational outcomes as traditional in-class courses.  This study evaluates educational outcomes from a traditional section and two distance sections of introductory agricultural microeconomics courses, Economics of the Food and Fiber System (AAEC 1005), taught at Virginia Tech. The study compares student learning, attitudes and interests in economics, and perceptions of instructor effectiveness between traditionally taught students and those taught through distance education. Average exam scores, and common exam questions given to students in both course types, are the measures of student learning used in this study. Attitudes and interest are measured by student survey, and perceptions of instructor effectiveness are measured by student course evaluations. A variety of statistical tests are conducted comparing distance and traditional students in order to determine the influence of delivery method on educational outcomes. Results indicate that traditional students generally obtain higher grades on tests, and have a higher opinion of course instruction than distance students, suggesting that distance education is not an equivalent educational alternative to traditional classroom instruction.

These include cylindrical shear layer/mixing layer flows, aircraft jets and wakes, shedding of leading edge and wing tip vortices, tornadoes, astrophysical plasma flows and flows in mechanical devices such as supersonic combustion chambers and cyclone separators. These and other applications have resulted in a high level of interest in the stability of axisymmetric and swirling jets. To date, the majority of studies on stability of axisymmetric and swirling jets have been completed under the assumption of steady flow in both axial and azimuthal (swirl) directions. Yet, flows such as the ones mentioned above can have an inherent unsteadiness. Moreover, such unsteadiness can be used to control stability and thus flow characteristics in axisymmetric and swirling jets. In this work effects of periodic variations on the temporal stability of axisymmetric and swirling jets is examined. The unsteadiness is introduced in the former as a periodic variation of the axial velocity component of the flow, and in the latter as a periodic variation of the azimuthal (swirl) velocity component of the flow. The temporal linear hydrodynamic stability of both steady inviscid axisymmetric and swirling jets is reviewed. An analytical dispersion relation is obtained in both cases and solved numerically. In the case of the steady axisymmetric jet, growth rate and celerity of unstable axisymmetric and helicalmodes are determined as functions of axial wavenumber. Results show that the inviscid axisymmetric jet is unstable to all values of axisymmetric and helical modes. In the case of the steady swirling jet, growth rate and celerity of axisymmetric modes are determined as functions of the axial wavenumber and swirl number. Results show that the inviscid swirling jet is unstable to all values of axial and azimuthal wavenumber, however, it is shown that increasing the swirl decreases the growth rate and increases the celerity of axisymmetric disturbances. The effects of periodic variations on the stability of a mixing layer is also reviewed. Results show that when the instability time scale is much smaller than the mean time scale a transformation of the time variable may be taken that, when the quasi-steady approach works, will reduce the unsteady field to that of the corresponding steady field in the new time scale. The price paid for this transformation, however, is a modulation of the amplitude and phase of the unsteady modes. Extending the results from the unsteady mixing layer, the stability of a periodically unsteady inviscid axisymmetric jet is considered. An analytical dispersion relation is obtained and results show that for the unsteady inviscid axisymmetric jet, the quasi-steady approach works. Following this, the stability of a periodically unsteady swirling jet is considered and an analytical dispersion relation is obtained. It is shown that for the unsteady inviscid swirling jet, the quasi-steady approach does not work. Resulting modulations of unsteady modes are shown via a numerical solution to the unsteady dispersion relation. In both cases, using established results for unsteady mixing layers, these results are substantiated analytically by showing that the unsteady axisymmetric jet can be reduced the the exact equational form of the steady axisymmetric jet in a new time scale, whereas the unsteady swirling jet cannot.

These characteristics are useful when thermal energy between two or more fluids must be exchanged without mixing. Most compact heat exchangers are liquid-to-air heat exchangers, with approximately 85% of the total thermal resistance occurring on the air side of the heat exchanger. To reduce the space and weight of a compact heat exchanger, augmentation strategies must be proposed to reduce the air side resistance. However, before any strategies to augment the air side heat transfer can be proposed, a thorough insight of the current mechanisms that govern air side heat transfer is required.  The tube wall heat transfer results presented in this paper were obtained both experimentally and computationally for a typical compact heat exchanger design. Both isothermal and constant heat flux tube walls were studied. For the experimental investigation, a scaled-up model of the louvered fin-tube wall was tested in a flow facility. Although computational results for the isothermal tube wall are shown, control of the experimental isothermal tube wall proved to be unrealistic and only heat transfer measurements along the constant heat flux tube wall were made. For the constant heat flux tube wall, reasonable agreement has been achieved between the measurements and the steady, three-dimensional computational predictions.  The results of the study showed that high heat transfer coefficients existed at the entrance to the louver array as well as in the louver reversal region. Vortices created at the leading edge of the louvers augmented heat transfer by thinning the tube wall boundary layer. Results indicate that an augmentation ratio of up to 3 times can occur for a tube wall of a louvered fin compact heat exchanger as compared to a flat plate.

Quantifying the role of urban forests is an important prerequisite to managing the vegetation to optimize benefits, and also serves to assign value to the important ecosystem services provided by urban trees. Decisions by policy-makers regarding the management and use of urban trees requires accurate and precise information about the state of the resource. This paper creates a methodology for conducting a carbon inventory in an urban forest in the Washington, DC area, one that requires a minimum of data gathering. The methodology could serve as a tool for other similar high-density urban areas to measure carbon resources in urban forests and to serve as the basis for further research. Carbon trading systems may provide opportunities for forest owners to sell carbon credits to entities that produce CO2 in excess of national or international limits; quantifying urban forest carbon would be necessary as a baseline for future carbon offset projects.

Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method that can predict the elastic modulus and damping capability in the form of Joule heat for any piezoelectric ceramic-reinforced metal matrix composite system. Specifically, barium titanate (BaTiO₃), lead titanate (PbTiO₃), and zinc oxide (ZnO) piezoelectric ceramics have been modeled as dispersed particles shaped as spheres, prolate spheroids, and discs within a host of common structural metallic matrices including 304 stainless steel, mild steel, aluminum, brass, copper, lead, magnesium, nickel, Ni-20wt%Cr, tin, titanium, Ti-6Al-4V(at%), and tungsten. Composite systems that were predicted to exhibit the greatest level of damping capacity include copper, aluminum, and magnesium matrices reinforced with PbTiO₃, BaTiO₃, and ZnO, in descending order of damping magnitude. In general, higher-conducting, lower-stiffness metallic matrices coupled with more-piezoelectric, higher-stiffness ceramic reinforcement resulted in the greatest level of predicted damping capability and enhanced composite elastic modulus. Additionally, a Ni-20wt%Cr-30v%BaTiO₃ composite has been created using mechanical alloying processing. Specifically, pure constituent powders were combined stoichiometrically in a SPEX milling vial utilizing a charge ratio of 4:1 and subsequently milled for 24 hours. Separate composite powder samples were then annealed in a hydrogen tube furnace at 400°C,  500°C, and 600°C for one and five hours at each temperature. X-ray diffraction was performed on the as-milled and the annealed powders revealing that each was composed of the starting constituents in the appropriate proportions. Representative powders were mounted and polished using common metallographic procedures and microstructures were examined by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. All of the powders exhibited a good dispersion of BaTiO₃ particles ranging in diameter from 1μm to about 25nm with no noticeable difference between the as-milled and the annealed powders.

Several studies have shown qualitative and quantitative benefits of the XDL intersection without providing accessible tools for traffic engineers and planners to estimate average control delays, and queues. Modeling was conducted on typical geometries over a wide distribution of traffic flow conditions for three different design configurations or cases using VISSIM simulations with pre-timed signal settings. Some comparisons with similar conventional designs show considerable savings in average control delay, and average queue length and increase in intersection capacity. The statistical models provide an accessible tool for a practitioner to assess average delay and average queue length for three types of XDL intersections. Pre-timed signal controller settings are provided for each of the five intersections of the XDL network.  In this research, a \"real-time\" traffic signal control strategy is developed using genetic algorithms and neural networks to provide near-optimal traffic performance for XDL intersections. Knowing the traffic arrival pattern at an intersection in advance, it is possible to come up with the best signal control strategy for the respective scenario. Hypothetical cases of traffic arrival patterns are generated and genetic algorithms are used to come up with near-optimal signal control strategy for the respective cases. The neural network controller is then trained and tested using pairs of hypothetical traffic scenarios and corresponding signal control strategies. The developed neural network controller produces near-optimal traffic signal control strategy in \"real-time\" for all varieties of traffic arrival patterns.

The region is prone to flash flooding, typically the result of localized precipitation. Fortunately, within the region, there is an efficient system of instruments for real-time data gathering with IFLOWS (Integrated Flood Observing and Warning System) gages, WSR-88D Doppler radar, and high precision GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver. The focus of this research is to combine the measurements from these various sensors in an algorithmic framework to determine the flash flood magnitude. It has been found that the trend in the GPS signals serves as a precursor for rain events with a lead-time of 30 minutes to 2 hours. The methodology proposed herein takes advantage of this lead-time as the trigger to initiate alert related calculations. It is shown here that the sum of the rates of change of total cloud water, water vapor contents and logarithmic profiles of partial pressure of dry air and temperature in an atmospheric column is equal to the rain rate. The total water content is measurable as the profiles of integrated precipitable water (IPW) from the GPS, the vertically integrated liquid (VIL) from the radar (representing different phases of the atmospheric water) and the pressure and temperature profiles are available. An example problem is presented illustrating the involving the calculations.
